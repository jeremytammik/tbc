<p style="text-align:center"><strong>"How developers can ride and profit from the <br/>Autodesk Exchange Apps adoption wave"</strong></p>

<p>There are currently 15 Autodesk Exchange Apps stores.
They represent a huge opportunity for developers to gain direct access to the growing number of Autodesk customers using Exchange Apps.
In just one year they have enjoyed over one million visits and over 250,000 downloads.
With comments like “<em>one of my most useful tools”, “love this app, saved me hours of work”</em>, there’s no doubt that Exchange Apps has become a resource that Autodesk customers rely on to find useful apps of all types.</p>

You’re invited to attend a webinar on June 13<sup>th</sup> hosted by Jim Quanci and Stephen Preston to learn how you can catch the wave and participate in the accelerating growth of Exchange Apps.</p>

<p>You’ll learn the tricks of the trade when publishing on Exchange Apps, get ideas on how to be successful and learn about the ability to publish localized apps.
