<h3>Design Automation for Revit in Public Beta</h3>
<p>The long-awaited public beta phase for Design Automation for Revit (aka Revit IO and DA4R) has finally arrived!</p>
<p><a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/design-automation-revit-public-beta-here">The public beta is here</a> today.</p>
<p>Design Automation for Revit makes the power of the Revit API available as a Forge-based service.</p>
<p>Using Design Automation for Revit, you can create, edit, and extract data from Revit models without a local Revit install. Because Design Automation is a cloud service, you can use it to create cloud-native applications that work with Revit data. Examples of ways you can use this API include: creating models automatically by entering parameters, validating specified design criteria and generating reports, and automatically modifying the model. It is also possible to extract model data not accessible with the Forge Model Derivative API.</p>
<p>For a high-level introduction, watch the <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/Revit-Data-Forge-How-Can-Design-Automation-Revit-API-Help-Me-2018">AU class recording</a>.</p>
<p>Our previous discussion of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/11/forge-design-automation-for-revit-at-au-and-in-public.html">Design Automation for Revit at AU and in public</a> highlights
both that class, FDC226894, by the Autodesk Revit API development team, and another, AS226079, on managing Revit digital content using DA4R, by external alpha phase developers.</p>
<p>The official <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview">Forge Design Automation documentation</a> has
been updated to include the new Revit functionality.</p>
<p>It includes a <a href="https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/tutorials/revit">tutorial providing a good starting point to understand how DA4R works</a>.</p>
<p>We also encourage you to join the <a href="https://beta.autodesk.com/key/Forge_Design_Automation_API_Revit">DA4R beta forum</a> to
see announcements and connect with the development team as well as other partners &amp; customers.</p>
<p>More tools and samples to help you get started with DA4R are in the works. Stay tuned...</p>
