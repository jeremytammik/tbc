<h3>Trusted Signature and Revit 2017 API Resources</h3>
<p>Here is a bunch of long overdue news items to round off this hot week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Trusted add-in signature</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Revit 2017 API news summary</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">ADN training labs for Revit 2017</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">ADN Xtra labs Revit 2017 migration</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Trusted Add-in Signature</h4>
<p>We had an extensive discussion on the topic of equipping each Revit add-in with a trusted signature in order to avoid the warning presented before loading it that otherwise pops up and needs to be manually confirmed by the user.</p>
<p>It started off in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/code-signing-of-revit-addins/m-p/5981560">code signing of Revit add-ins</a> even
before the initial customer release.</p>
<p>I continued adding new material to it as various more specific queries came in from developers over time.</p>
<p>I hope it now includes a clear explanation of all aspects of the situation.</p>
<p>The latest addition is probably the most complete and succinct summary:</p>
<p>Question: "When Revit 2017 opens with my in-house developed add-in, it prompts the user for an action: always load, load once or do not load. Since the app is in-house developed, I wonder: is it always necessary to have a certificate also for in-house trusted area?"</p>
<p>Answer: The answer is yes; the warning will always be issued.</p>
<p>Our security architect adds:</p>
<p>The add-in must be signed with an approved cert or it will display the popup on first load.</p>
<p>We've documented the process
of <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2017/ENU/?guid=GUID-B9A067F4-234F-47F8-A5EE-0D84A93FA98E">creating a self-signed cert that can be used for your own internal use</a>.</p>
<p>You
can <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd807084(v=ws.11).aspx">push the cert to machines in your domain using group policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you both sign the add-in and push the cert to domain machines, users can use the add-in without the popup.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Revit 2017 API News Summary</h4>
<p>Next, here is the rather overdue publication of the Revit 2017 API news presentations from the DevDays conferences around the turn of the year:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>ADN Training Labs for Revit 2017</h4>
<p>As usual, the training material used by the Autodesk Developer Network ADN for hands-on Revit API introductory trainings has been updated for Revit 2017 and is available from GitHub in
the <a href="https://github.com/ADN-DevTech/RevitTrainingMaterial">Revit API Labs Training Material repository</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/technology_perspective/ryuji-ogasawara.html">Ryuji Ogasawara</a> for
the migration and clean-up for Revit 2017!</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>ADN Xtra Labs Revit 2017 Migration</h4>
<p>I also migrated the ADN Xtra Labs to Revit 2017.</p>
<p>It includes the same training material as the official ADN version mentioned above, plus a series of so-called Xtra labs containing the material we before restructuring and documenting the labs in a more didactical fashion.</p>
<p>The older labs have a different history and approach, provide some alternative insights, and include a couple of tools and utilities that I still find worthwhile to preserve and maintain.</p>
<p>The migration to Revit 2017 is very straightforward.</p>
<p>The first step is to update the .NET target framework from 4.5 to 4.5.2 and update the Revit API assembly references to point to the new Revit.exe folder.</p>
<p>Doing so produces zero errors for this add-in, just a couple of warnings.</p>
<p>Here are my migration steps with all the intermediate releases, differences between each step and the previous one and log files listing the warnings produced at that point:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.0">2017.0.0.0</a>
&ndash; initial flat migration to Revit 2017
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2016.0.0.10...2017.0.0.0">diffs</a>
&ndash; <a href="zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_01.txt">25 warnings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.1">2017.0.0.1</a>
&ndash; cleaned up various paths pointing to 2016
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.0...2017.0.0.1">diffs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.2">2017.0.0.2</a>
&ndash; fixed all warnings about deprecated API usage except Automatic transaction mode
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.1...2017.0.0.2">diffs</a>
&ndash; <a href="zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_02.txt">35 warnings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.3">2017.0.0.3</a>
&ndash; eliminated some of the deprecated Automatic transaction mode usages
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.2...2017.0.0.3">diffs</a>
&ndash; <a href="zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_03.txt">29 warnings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2017.0.0.4">2017.0.0.4</a>
&ndash; eliminated all deprecated Automatic transaction mode usage in all C# modules except Lab3.cs
&ndash; <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/compare/2017.0.0.3...2017.0.0.4">diffs</a>
&ndash; <a href="zip/adn_xtra_2017_warnings_04.txt">19 warnings</a></li>
</ol>
<p>19 warnings about use of the obsolete and deprecated automatic transaction mode remain, so I am still not completely done.</p>
<p>In any case, these diffs and logs should give you a very clear idea of how to approach any migration issues that you may encounter.</p>
