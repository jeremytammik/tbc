- Revit 2023: Parameters Service
  https://youtu.be/cRz7kQz88mA
  2:36 video
  Manage your parameters library more efficiently across projects and locations using the Parameters Service with Revit and the Autodesk Construction Cloud

- 2023 parameters:
  Jesika DiGregorio
  This post is part of my ongoing effort to be proactively prepared for the transition from BuiltInParameter to the ForgeTypeId equivalent ParameterTypeId.
  I have a few questions about how modifications to the ParameterTypeId will be documented. I am trying to ensure that if I reference a particular parameter by ParameterTypeId I can track when I need to handle a change between Revit versions and the new value that should be used, as well as write code to translate serialization that may have been generated by a different version of Revit.
  1. Currently when a BuiltInParameter value is renamed I can easily tell by comparing the enumeration between 2 versions and seeing that two values with the same numeric value have a different enumeration value. The ParameterTypeId doesn't have a corresponding value that can help track renames and there is currently no note in the summary indicating it was renamed. What technique should we use to correlate such a change between Revit versions and now that it was a rename rather than a drop and add?
  Example:
  * 2022 Revit: "Electrial Load Zone Type" 
  RBS_ELECTRICAL_LOAD_ZONE_TYPE = -1153533 
  ParameterTypeId.RbsElectricalLoadZoneType
  * December Preview Build: "Area Based Load Type" 
  RBS_AREA_BASED_LOAD_TYPE = -1153533 
  ParameterTypeId.RbsAreaBasedLoadType
  2. BuiltInParameter has a few "equivalents", values with different names but the same numeric values. Will ParameterTypeId have a similar implementation in the future? In the December Preview Build, it appears that the ParameterTypeId references were renamed in the cases where an equivalent was added to BuiltInParameter for that value.
  Example:
  * Revit 2022: "Spot Top Elevation with Insulation"
  FABRICATION_SPOT_TOP_ELEVATION_INCLUDE_INSULATION_OF_PART = -1140985
  ParameterTypeId.FabricationSpotTopElevationIncludeInsulationOfPart
  * December Preview Build: "Spot Top of Insulation Elevation"
  FABRICATION_SPOT_TOP_ELEVATION_INCLUDE_INSULATION_OF_PART = -1140985
  MEP_SPOT_TOP_ELEVATION_INCLUDE_INSULATION = -1140985
  ParameterTypeId.MepSpotTopElevationIncludeInsulation
  3. If I have an older (from 2022) ForgeTypeId.TypeId value stored for a ParameterTypeId that has been renamed in the new version, will the new version of Revit know that it is equivalent to the one with the new name? 
  Specifically using the old value to create a ForgeTypeId and then either comparing it to one retrieved from a parameter definition using NameEquals(ForgeTypeId other) or use it to call Element.GetParameter(ForgeTypeId parameterTypeId)? 
  I understand the the older version of Revit won't know, but only having one direction to manage is better than both.

  Good morning Jesika, these are great questions, and a Happy New Year to you! You've nailed it, and I hope the rest of my answer won't bum you out too much. Because of the issues you describe, only the ElementId will identify a built-in parameter consistently across Revit versions. The ForgeTypeId string of a built-in parameter is generated from the parameter's symbolic identifier. In your first example, the symbolic identifier changes from one release to the next. In your second example, a new symbolic identifier is introduced and the original one is treated as an alias, but only the new one produces a ForgeTypeId string. To recover the underlying ElementId from a ForgeTypeId string, use [code]ParameterUtils.GetBuiltInParameter(ForgeTypeId)[/code]. For the opposite conversion, use [code]ParameterUtils.GetParameterTypeId(BuiltInParameter)[/code]. 
  To your third question: No, Revit does not know that the old and new ForgeTypeId strings correspond to the same ElementId. [code]ForgeTypeId.NameEquals(ForgeTypeId)[/code] behaves the same way as the default equality comparison operator for ForgeTypeId objects; it simply compares the strings inside the two ForgeTypeId objects while ignoring their version numbers. [code]Element.GetParameter(ForgeTypeId)[/code] maps the given ForgeTypeId to its corresponding ElementId before searching for the matching parameter, but it does not have a record of legacy ForgeTypeId strings for built-in parameters.

<li>Go to START </li>
<li>Enter REGEDIT</li>
<li>Go to the following registry key:

<p>You will see a bunch of GUID value names with data values 0 or 1.
Each one is for a different plugin you codesigned.

<li>From a cmd prompt, run MMC, the Microsoft Management Console. 
  You may also type MMC after bringing up the Windows ‘Start’ menu.</li>
<li>File &gt; Add/Remove Snap-in... &gt; Certificates &gt; Add &gt; My user account &gt; Okay.</li>
<li>Navigate to Certificates - Current User &gt; Trusted Publishers &gt; Certificates.</li>
<li>You should now see a list of signatures.</li>
<li>Proceed with extreme caution.</li>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a simple addon that iterates over all the families in a document and exports them to a folder amongst other things, using <code>fam.SaveAs(path, options)</code>.</p>
<p>All works as expected until the very rare case when it hits a family that is corrupt.
This doesn't happen often, but it does happen.
When it hits such a family there are no warning messages, doesn't crash, just hangs.</p>
<p>My question: Is there a way that I can check for this situation or a way to skip on to the next family?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I don't think so.</p>
<p>You can't cancel the process either so also no possibility of setting a time limit. Only thing you could do is create a logging system where the last item that caused the issue along with those already exported up to that point can be skipped on the next run of the Add-in.</p>
<p>For these kind of issues, all you can really do from an API developer perspective is get end user to open a support case with Autodesk regarding the attached project file (or you could open one).
A brief review of the journal indicates an issue with many short curves.</p>
<p>Regarding end user support case they can easily replicate the issue outside of the API by attempting to edit the family in the UI.
It seems to be getting stuck in a regeneration loop and may eventually resolve.
I wouldn't classify it as document corruption because that tends to have an abrupt end, i.e., file would not open and error message would be shown in UI.
Seems to be an issue with how Revit responds to a certain circumstance that the file causes, i.e., problem with Revit.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>It was what I thought but just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing anything.</p>
<p>This is meant to be a totally automated process with no user interaction so is a bit of a shame I can't get around this catch and move on.
What I will have to do is set a timer and if there is a long period of time opening a family, pop up a message box of some sort to notify the user of the issue when they get back to their workstation.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Should also mention the <code>ProgressChangedEventArgs.Cancel</code> of <code>Application.ProgressChanged</code>.</p>
<p>This reports the progress of the little green bar that appears in the bottom left.
This has a cancel button next to it that is available when opening a family.
So, it may be possible to cancel via that if you spot a recurring pattern of progress as appears to happen with this family, e.g., how many times it goes to 25% after 50% etc.</p>
<p>ProgressChangedEventArgs.Caption may also report <code>Regenerating</code>, so you could also count those and set limits on that.</p>
<p>This all hinges on if ProgressChangedEventArgs.Cancel works, i.e., it works in the UI immediately for the family in question.</p>
<p>Below is an example that seems to work well for English Language Revit.</p>
<p>When you call cancel on the event it throws an exception for the calling method so you can catch that and move onto the next item. The below works by counting the occurrences of "Regenerating", a count of around 2200 is about right for that family (when it starts to loop).</p>
<p>You could as an alternative use the progress Position property but to get a percentage you need to divide the Position property by the UpperRange property. This approach doesn't seem as good as the regen caption approach because the percentages encountered are more random and not a good indicator of a pattern of repetition (would have to store more in an array to check against).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

  Private Sub ProgressChanged(a As Object, e As Autodesk.Revit.DB.Events.ProgressChangedEventArgs)

<p>This below non-language dependant example appears to work also.
In below I attempt to edit the problem family before moving on to a second family in the project file that does open.</p>
<p>Again, you have to look at the numbers for variables N and T below.

<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> Following up on some of your initial thoughts, I would assume that this can be totally automated after all, like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run an external Windows app that monitors progress and can kill Revit.exe by terminating the process via native OS calls</li>
<li>Loop through all the families and call SaveAs on each, logging progress to an external file (or wherever you like)</li>
<li>The log file helps keep track of where you are and where you need to proceed next</li>
<li>If the external file has not been updated for a while (a minute? ten minutes?), kill Revit.exe and restart with the next family to export, logging and skipping the corrupt one</li>
</ul>
<p>Sound feasible? It is a pretty standard approach to run a batch process.
Revit is not designed for batch processing dozens of files, let alone hundreds or thousands, so crashes of all kinds are to be expected, perfectly normal, and need to be handled gracefully by batch processing workflows.
