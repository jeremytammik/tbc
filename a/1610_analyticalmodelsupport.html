I'm trying to retrieve connected framing elements through the API.
My end goal is to select a beam and retrieve the element id of the elements its ends are framing into.
I have been able to do this by checking location intersection of all other beams, but this scales by <code>n^2</code> based on the number of beams for the check.
I read the article on finding connected structural elements, but I'm confused on the actual implementation of it.
Has anybody come across a working example showing how to
call <code>GetAnalyticalModelSupports</code>? ...

<h3>How to Use GetAnalyticalModelSupports</h3>
<p>I highlight yet another thread from 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>,
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/getanalyticalmodelsupports-how-to-use-this/m-p/7503547">how to use GetAnalyticalModelSupports</a>,
answered by Dragos Turmac, Autodesk Software Engineer, and with additional usage hints by J. Peele, who also raised the question in the first place:</p>

<p>I'm not sure what objects have this property since they all seem to inherit it. Or am I missing an import?</p>
<p>I'm working in Python. Here is the code so far:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  import clr
  clr.AddReference('ProtoGeometry')
  from Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry import *

  # Import RevitAPI
  clr.AddReference('RevitAPI')
  import Autodesk
  from Autodesk.Revit.DB import *

  # Import ToDSType(bool) extension method
  clr.AddReference('RevitNodes')
  import Revit
  clr.ImportExtensions(Revit.Elements)

  from Autodesk.Revit.DB.Structure import *

  # The inputs to this node will be stored as a list in the IN variables.
  dataEnteringNode = IN

  if isinstance(IN[0], list):
    elements = [UnwrapElement(i) for i in IN[0]]
  else:
    elements = [UnwrapElement(IN[0])]

  AnalyticalEl = [element.GetAnalyticalModel() for element in elements]

  # Assign your output to the OUT variable.
  OUT = AnalyticalEl;
</pre>

<p>Thanks so much for any help you can give.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Does this snippet work for you and answer your question?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:blue;">continue</span>;

&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#2b91af;">IList</span>&lt;<span style="color:#2b91af;">AnalyticalModelSupport</span>&gt;&nbsp;supports&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;}
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Finally got it working yesterday.</p>
<p>This code does the trick, though the problem was a conceptual oversight on my part.</p>
<p>I was imagining the supports would be similar to what pressing tab on a beam element does; however, it seems the supports are actually the members involved in the gravity load path.</p>
<p>More importantly, the analytical supports will be null if Revit has 'Automatic Member Supports' turned off (as it should be, Revit is unusably slow on large projects with it on).</p>
<p>I had to run a manual support check before anything would show up.</p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone having similar issue to what I ran into. Also, if there is any way to programmatically get the connected beams similar to how tab behaviour works, I would still be interested to learn how.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Dragos and J. for raising and solving this issue!</p>
