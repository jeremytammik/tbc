  Q: I'm trying to compile the SDK Revit 2019.2 Samples, but the buttons are disabled. Do you have any suspicion of what may be happening?
  A: yes: https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/05/compiling-the-revit-2021-sdk-samples.html
  You should also read The numerous Building Coder descriptions of all the various problems encountered installing them for previous versions. Please refer to the blog!

<h4><a name="2"></a> How to Determine Revit Export Image Coordinates</h4>
<p>Raised in the StackOverflow question
on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62004785/how-to-get-revit-export-image-coordinates-or-reference-point">how to get Revit export image coordinates or reference point</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I want to have a reference point or know the coordinates of any point on an exported Image (from any view) from Revit.</p>
<p>For example, in this Revit floor plan export, I'd like to know the bounding box of the picture, its middle point, or any other reliable reference point:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/floor_plan.jpg" alt="Floor plan" title="Floor plan" width="500"/> <!-- 3093 -->
</center></p>
<p>Is there a way to extract the bounding box coordinates of the picture?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I would suggest defining two diagonally opposite points in your image file that you can identify precisely in your Revit model.</p>
<p>Determine their image pixel coordinates, export their Revit model coordinates, and use this information to determine the appropriate scaling and translation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RoomEditorApp">RoomEditorApp Revit add-in</a> and its
corresponding <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit">roomedit CouchDb</a> web interface
demonstrate exporting an SVG image from Revit, scaling it for display in a web browser, and transformation and calculation of exact coordinates back and forth between two environments.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you for your reply Jeremy, I'm looking into that.</p>
<p>I've noticed the <code>BoundingBoxUV</code> in the view I'm exporting changing based on the elements on the edges of the view; can this bounding box help me determine the exported image bounding box?</p>
<p>The units are different than the "specify coordinates at point", so I'm not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> They might certainly be useful, and almost equally certainly they will not enable any totally reliable and precise transformation.</p>
<p>Therefore, I would still stick with my initial suggestion.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Problems Compiling and Installing the Revit SDK Samples</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I'm trying to compile the SDK Revit 2019.2 Samples, but the buttons are disabled:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/rvtsamples_greyed_out.png" alt="RvtSamples greyed out" title="RvtSamples greyed out" width="500"/> <!-- 1035 -->
</center></p>
<p>Do you have any suspicion of what may be happening?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, certainly.</p>
<p>Actually, what you show in the screen snapshot is the external application RvtSamples that creates a user interface to load and launch all the Revit SDK sample external commands.</p>
<p>The problem is probably caused by incorrect paths to the samples being specified in <code>RvtSamples.txt</code>.</p>
<p>I have run into similar issues many times over in the past, e.g., most lately,
<a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/05/compiling-the-revit-2021-sdk-samples.html">compiling the Revit 2021 SDK samples</a> and
<a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2020/05/setting-up-rvtsamples-for-revit-2021.html">setting up RvtSamples for Revit 2021</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out those two posts and

<h4><a name="4"></a> RvtVerFileOpen &ndash; Open Correct RVT File Version</h4>
<p>From a running Revit session, you can easily determine its version number via
the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/35b18b73-4c47-fee3-d2f9-21298f029f7f.htm">application <code>VersionNumber</code> property</a>, cf., e.g.,

<p>Determining the Revit version that saved an RVT file stored in the OS file system and not currently opened in Revit, however, is a different matter.</p>
<p>It can be handled using the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2020/475edc09-cee7-6ff1-a0fa-4e427a56262a.htm">BasicFileInfo class</a>,
as explained in several places, e.g., the discussion
on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/basic-file-info-and-rvt-file-version.html">basic file info and RVT file version</a>.</p>
<p>Vin Gallo now shared a new utility making use of that functionality in
his <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/01/basic-file-info-and-rvt-file-version.html#comment-4927991760">recent comment</a> on
that article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I've written a small app that opens any RVT file in the correct Revit version, simply by double-clicking the file in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>I have used some of the logic in this thread, which works for all versions of Revit up to 2021.</p>
<p>I can share the source code here, but it's probably better to just share the Visual Studio Source, if anybody is interested.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eqwwk0zb4s9hee1/RvtFileOpen.mp4?dl=0">short video</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1zvfnwxmju8z1z1/RvtVer.zip?dl=0">Source Code</a>.</p>
<p>To make it work, you'll have to associate RVT files with this app.</p>
</blockquote>
