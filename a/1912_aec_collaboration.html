<h4><a name="3"></a> Dockable Panels and WebView2</h4>
<p>Konrad Sobon presents a very nice general introduction get started with dockable panels in his article
on <a href="https://archi-lab.net/webview2-and-revits-dockable-panel">WebView2 and Revit’s Dockable Panel</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he runs into a problem using <code>WebView2</code> to host a browser in them.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Konrad for the nice introduction to dockable panels and subsequent problem analysis!</p>
<p>Jason Masters explained <a href="https://archi-lab.net/webview2-and-revits-dockable-panel/#comment-2813">how he solved the conflict using named pipes to connect to a separate UI process</a>, similar to the suggestion to achieve
<a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/set-floor-level-and-use-ipc-for-disentanglement.html#6">disentanglement and independence via IPC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s so frustrating, because DLL hell was solved by Microsoft, like 15 years ago, using strong naming, but Autodesk just doesn’t support it.</p>
<p>Personally, I just use Electron, built my whole client application there, and just shuttle <code>json</code> data back and forth to a thin Revit wrapper over named pipes.
Still, the potential for DLL conflicts with different versions of <code>Newtonsoft.json</code> remains, but thankfully its core API has stayed pretty stable and consistent.</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Dismissing Revit Pop-Ups</h4>
<p>Another article by Konrad
discusses <a href="https://archi-lab.net/dismissing-revit-pop-ups-the-easy-and-not-so-easy-ways">dismissing Revit pop-ups &ndash; the easy and not so easy ways</a> and
explains</p>
<ul>
<li>How to set up and use the <code>DialogBoxShowing</code> event for the Revit-API-style solution</li>
<li>Using the Win32Api <code>FindWindow</code> and <code>GetWindowText</code> methods to find the right button and simulate a user click on it</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet again many thanks to Konrad for this helpful overview!</p>
<p>This explanation nicely complements the existing articles in the topic group
5.32 on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.32">detecting and handling dialogues and failures</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Check API Changes using Decompilation</h4>
<p>Comparing changes between different versions of the Revit API is possible using
the free <a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy">ILSpy tool</a> (e.g., version 5.0.0.4861-preview3)
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the <code>RevitAPI.dll</code> assembly</li>
<li>Select the root node</li>
<li>Select File &gt; Save Code...</li>
<li>Select an empty folder to save all the decompiled source code</li>
<li>Create a git repo </li>
<li>Save the API source code</li>
</ul>
<p>Repeat this process with another version of <code>RevitAPI.dll</code> to generate the decompiled source code, commit into the git repo to compare the different releases and the changes between them.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a> Railing Geometry</h4>
<p>Some useful aspects of the tricky task of accessing railing geometry can be gleaned from these snippets of an internal discussion:</p>
<p>Q: How can I extract the geometry from a <code>RailingType</code> element?</p>
<p>A: Last time I tried, the best way to get geometry was using the <code>IModelExportContext</code>, but I forget whether a railing type actually has geometry one can get from API or if it's all on the railing.</p>
<p>There is also the <code>Element.Geometry</code> property, <code>GeometryElement</code> and <code>GeometryInstance</code> objects that can be obtained directly, but in case of railings it could have some specific complications.</p>
<p>Exactly, railings have a complicated representation and I have no idea what Element.get_Geometry actually gives for a RailingType.
So, I'd need to look into an example and see what they give and what's best to use.</p>
<p>For <code>RailingType</code> elements, <code>get_Geometry</code> returns null.
I then used <code>GetDependentElements</code> with a filter for <code>Railing</code> elements.
I can then call <code>get_Geometry</code> and/or <code>GetGeometryInstances</code> on the <code>Railing</code> element.
Is this a valid workflow?
Also, I would like to use <code>GetGeometryInstances</code> on the <code>Railing</code> element, but it is returning an identity transform; so, it is not using instanced geometry?</p>
<p>Well, a railing has its own RailingType, so the railing being an identity transform of something does make sense regardless of where the railing is positioned.</p>
<p>The issue is that the railing element is instanced 600 places in the model.
I thought I would be able to get the instance geometry and it's transform.</p>
<p>I'm confused &ndash; railings aren't instanced.</p>
<p>I think I answered my own question.
The RailingType has a dependent Railing element.
This Railing element has a GeometryInstance in its GeometryElement.
I can get the geometry and its transform from this element.</p>
<p>That sounds right &ndash; a Railing geometrically should be small, one or a few GeometryInstances would be expected.</p>
<p>There is some potential difference with the continuous rails; these are separate Elements but you may see them as part of the Railing's geometry.
In that case, it's also easy to encounter the continuous rails twice; in fact, Revit draws them twice, which is why you can tab select a top rail, for example, to toggle between the top rail alone and the railing which its attached to.</p>
