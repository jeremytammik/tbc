####<a name="3"></a> Normalising UVs in Custom Exporter

Sunsflower (sic) shared a nice explanation in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [`IExportContext` converting `UV` to the range (0,1)](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-api-iexportcontext-converting-uv-to-the-range-0-1/m-p/9638219):

**Question:** I'm writing an exporter for Revit and encountered with a problem when exporting UV.

When I call `PolymeshTopology.GetUV`, the coordinates given are often larger than 1.

My questions are:

- How can I convert them to the desired range (0,1)? Or how should I understand these UV values?
- Are they coordinates on the image? And If they are indeed coordinate on the image, how can I access the size of the image in `IExportContext`?

To give a concrete example:

Say I have a texture of size 4096x4096, the corresponding `UV` data I read in `IExportContext` is around 25, and the RealWorldScale from the UnifiedBitmapAsset is about 141.

I cannot seem to be able to discern a formula or anything...

**Answer:** Maybe this background information
on [faces and their coordinates in the Revit API](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/faces.html) will
help?

**Response:** That post explains UV as two variables that parametrise a face, but as far as I can see they are related to the structure of the face in 3d space, not how each vertex of the face are mapped to the bitmap.

How can I convert the UV coordinates returned by `PolymeshTopology.GetUV` to pixel coordinates on the image or in the range (0,1).

I found the discussion
on [PolymeshTopology UVs](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/polymeshtopology-uvs/td-p/8641007) to
be relevant, but the answer given is not detailed enough for me to actually solve the problem.

**Later:** Okay, I think I've figured it out and I'll list the solution found just in case someone else also has this problem...

The `PolymeshTopology.GetUV` method returns a `UV` coordinate, which corresponds to the parameters of a face.

Therefore, I guess they are related to the dimension of the face that they parameterize.

These UV coordinates can be converted to display units via `UnitUtils.ConvertFromInternalUnits` (which is probably deprecated now, but anyway...). 
My add-in uses centimetres.
So far, we have the UV in centimetres.

The next step is to obtain the size of the bitmap.
This is given by the properties with name `UnifiedBitmap.TextureRealWorldScaleX/Y`.
These values are actually given in inches, so you can call `UnitUtils.Convert` from  `DisplayUnitType.DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES` to `DisplayUnitType.DUT_CENTIMETERS` to convert them.
In fact, I've found `DisplayUnitType.DUT_FRACTIONAL_INCHES` gives the same result.
I don't know what the difference is... maybe someone could elaborate on that.

After that, the UV coordinates can be scaled to the range [0,1] or whatever.

**Correction:** the `AssetPropertyDistance` class actually has a `DisplayUnitType` property, which should be used instead of the `DUT_DECIMAL_INCHES`.

Many thanks to Sunsflower for this useful research and helpful documentation!
