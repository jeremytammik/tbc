<h3>The Birth of Roomedit3dv3 and Forge Webinar 2</h3>
<p>I made my choice on the starting point for the new <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d">roomedit3d</a> incarnation, and the second Forge webinar was successfully held:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">The birth of Roomedit3dv3</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Forge webinar series</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>The Birth of Roomedit3dv3</h4>
<p>So far, I evaluated two of Augusto's apps and Philippe's series of boilerplate sample apps as potential starting points for a new incarnation
of <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3d">roomedit3d</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/data.management-nodejs-integration.box">data.management-nodejs-integration.box</a>, demonstrating 3-legged OAuth access to models on A360 and transferring them back and forth between A360 and the <a href="https://www.box.com">Box content management platform</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Developer-Autodesk/model.derivative-nodejs-box.viewer">model.derivative-nodejs-box.viewer</a>, demonstrating access to models on Box and displaying them in the Forge Viewer.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Autodesk-Forge/forge-boilers.nodejs">forge-boilers.nodejs</a> demonstrating the suite of Forge APIs and components:<ul>
<li>Authenticate and authorise the user &ndash; <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/oauth/v2">Authentication (OAuth)</a></li>
<li>Access and download a RVT project file from A360 &ndash; <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/data/v2">Data Management API</a></li>
<li>Translate and access its geometry and metadata &ndash; <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2">Model Derivative API</a></li>
<li>Display to the user &ndash; <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2">Viewer</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is fully documented in its own GitHub repository, and the first two are briefly highlighted in Augusto's discussion
on <a href="http://adndevblog.typepad.com/cloud_and_mobile/2016/09/box-forge.html">Box &amp; Forge</a>.</p>
<p>I also made some notes on them in my first search for a
suitable <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/09/roomedit3d-update-for-connecting-desktop-and-forge.html#4">roomedit3dv3 starting point</a>,
followed by <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/09/forge-webinar-series-and-more-roomedit-starting-point-samples.html#2">more roomedit3dv3 starting points</a>.</p>
<p>I finally decided to go for the latter, for the sake of completeness.
Besides including all the Forge APIs that I might possibly need, it also makes use of a full web development and deployment stack including
the <a href="https://webpack.github.io">Webpack module bundler</a> and NPM packages to build and generate the frontend code.
On one hand, this requires an extra build step.
On the other, it directly supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#ES6">ES6 code</a>, since all the JavaScript is passed through <a href="https://babeljs.io">Babel</a> via the webpack build and bundling step.</p>
<p>I forked Philippe's repository and renamed it
to <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3dv3">roomedit3dv3</a>,
tagging this initial forked state as <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3dv3/releases/tag/0.0.0">release 0.0.0</a> in
order to track all further changes right from the start. </p>
<p>So far, all I have done is rewrite the documentation, remove the simpler boilerplate code samples #1-#5, and test that the one I am using, #6, still is in a working state.
I now reached <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3dv3/releases/tag/0.0.4">release 0.0.4</a> just doing that.</p>
<p>I actually hope and expect that work to be the largest chunk, and that adapting the existing viewer extension to do its job in the new environment will be less work the documentation work already completed &nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>It is looking good, though, and you can check out the further details by looking at the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/roomedit3dv3">readme</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Forge Webinar Series</h4>
