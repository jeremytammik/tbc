####<a name="4"></a> Backward Compatible 64 Bit Element Id

Richard [RPThomas108](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1035859) Thomas
shares code for handling `ElementId` 64 bit backward compatibility in the thread
on [upgrade 2024 API causing schema error](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/upgrade-2024-api-causing-schema-error/td-p/11953147),
explaining:

> The change to `Int64` should be transparent for most situations;
there is a design decision some developers will need to consider in terms of how the `ElementId` `IntegerValue` property is replaced with the old `Value`.
I decided it was better to update backwards the base code with an extension method `ElementId.Value`.
Can't do much about the constructor, however:

<pre class="prettyprint">
Module RT_ElementIdExtensionModule

#If RvtVer &gt;= 2024 Then
    &lt;Extension&gt;
    Public Function NewElementId(L As Long) As ElementId
        Return New ElementId(L)
    End Function
#Else
     &lt;Extension&gt;
    Public Function Value(ID As ElementId) As Long
        Return ID.IntegerValue
    End Function
    &lt;Extension&gt;
    Public Function NewElementId(L As Long) As ElementId
        If L &gt; Int32.MaxValue OrElse L &lt; Int32.MinValue Then
            Throw New OverflowException("Value for ElementId out of range.")
        End If
        Return New ElementId(CInt(L))
    End Function
#End If

End Module
</pre>

Many thanks to Richard for sharing this approach.

####<a name="5"></a> 15-Minute Cities

I just noticed Kean Walmsley;s nice discucussion
of [15-minute cities, 20-minute neighbourhoods and 30-second offices](https://www.keanw.com/2023/02/15-minute-cities-20-minute-neighbourhoods-and-30-second-offices.html).

####<a name="6"></a> Cloud Data Carbon Footprint

You have probably seen hundreds if not thousands of email footers reminding you not to print every email you receive on paper.

Now the time has come to add a reminder not to save ever bit of information you receive digitally either.

Apparently, storing 100 GB of data in the cloud results in a carbon footprint of about 0.2 tons of CO2 per year.

That is about the same as:

- Burning 45 kg of coal
- Driving a car for approximately 965 km
- The production of about 1,000 plastic bags
