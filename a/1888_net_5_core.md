- .NET Core

  [Q] Rahul Bhobe 18 Nov 2020 at 20:28
  A question on my AU class page: Will we be able to use the Revit API with .NET 5? Do we have a blog post announcement on this?
  [A] Scott Conover
  We should try to be prepared to answer.  So far, there are complications.  Revit consumes Autodesk wide .NET components.  We'd need to ensure that those are .NET 5 compatible before we switch our runtime.  Revit API also runs in-process using Revit's runtime, so I'm not sure it would be possible to preserve Revit's 4.8 runtime and allow add-in code to run .NET 5.0.   We have not tested either scenario yet.  Any other thoughts @Jan Richter or others on this thread?
  [A] Jan Richter
  Basically, they will be able to reference Revit's dlls (.NET 4.8) in their .NET 5 projects, but there is no guarantee that everything will work. Some (if not most) things might, but I would not recommend going that way. The problem is that .NET 5 is based on .NET Core, not on the big .NET framework, and there are some incompatibilities.
  As for switching Revit to .NET 5, that's something we will definitely need to do as .NET 4.8 is the last version of the big .NET. However, the switch is not as trivial as changing the version dropdown (like it was from 4.7 to 4.8). We will have to convert to a new project format, fix some code and possibly find replacement for some frameworks that were present in .NET 4.8, but are not anymore in .NET 5. (edited)

- I was and still remain a fan of NoSQl, even after being intrigued by and reading an article by John Biggs and Ryan Donovan asking,
  [Have the tables turned on NoSQL?](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/14/have-the-tables-turned-on-nosql) and concluding that
  NoSQL is "not so great for your side hustle" and that "a consensus has emerged in conferences and blogs that SQL is the gold
  standard &ndash; with a lot of emphasis on PostgeSQL &ndash; and you should use it by default, only deviating if you have
  good reasons to use NoSQL." I assume they know a lot more than I do in that area, so I guess I should trust their judgement
  more than mine in this case.

### .NET 5 and Core


####<a name="2"></a> 

[Olli Kattelus](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/774564), MEP Software Engineer of the Finnish MagiCAD Group,
updated the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) 
question [does Revit target .NET standard](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/does-revit-target-net-standard/m-p/10021984) to
include coverage of .NET 5:

**Question:** I would like to use .NET Core to build my plugin, but I'm a bit confused whether it will cause issues or not.
From my understanding of .NET, if Revit targets a specific .NET standard, I will be able use any implementation of .NET (.NET Core, or .NET Framework) that conforms to that standard.
Does Revit target versions of .NET standards or does it just target versions of .NET Framework?

**Answer:**

This is clearly defined in the system requirements:

 

For Revit 2021:

 


https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2021/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_Introduction_Getting_Started_html

The Revit Platform API is fully accessible by any language compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8, such as Visual C# or Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET). Both Visual C# and VB.NET are commonly used to develop Revit Platform API applications.

  
If your .NET core is compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework 4.8, all should be fine.
 
Please try it out and let us know the result!

I found the official Microsoft overview
of [What's new in .NET 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five) pretty illuminating.
