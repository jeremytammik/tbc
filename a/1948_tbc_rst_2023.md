I am aware of significant und hard, sudden changes to the Structural API in Revit 2023. Question: how does one migrate the obsolete method GetAnalyticalModel to the new framework? I looked at the ContextualAnalyticalModel Revit 2023 SDK sample and found no hints there. I studied the Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx document included with the Revit 2023 SDK and found no answer there either. Where else can I look, please?

We have a report that our plugin that won't load in Revit 2021.  It is loading in the versions that we have installed on our dev machines.  Is there a way that we can test this on a clean machine with no developer tools installed?  For example, can we get an ECS Vapor machine with Revit 2021 preloaded?

The developer asks: Is there any news on this topic? Otherwise, I will just use my own string list, no big problem...

@Romeo Belciug, are you aware of any other documentation that we can share with the add-in developer community to explain and introduce the changes? Or should I just publish a blog post pointing to this material that you already highlighted? Is that sufficient, or do we have anything else?

A problem with DB.NurbSpline.Create; the resulting curve does not visualise control points. Created manually, NurbSpline elements are generated. The API generates HermiteSpline elements instead, even though the code is using DB.NurbSpline.Create. How can this be fixed, please? Should a Jira issue be submitted?

DB.NurbSpline.Create does not visualize control points
Dear RevitAPI,I have built a DB.Floor using two lines and two splines programmatically. I was expecting to find the control points available to me once done, but they aren't, as you see in this picture. What really should happen is this (manually designed Spline on the Floor's sketch plane). You see I can see the 4 control points, add some, delete some, change some.   The code I used to generate the floor is the following.     with DB.Transaction(doc,

Hello @Jeremy Tammik. Please see this help page where you can find some samples at the bottom of it (https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-A1157199-4E27-41F9-BF45-53A5CD79E9A1). The sample which describes how to access the analytical element for a given physical element is in the section named: Gets the associated analytical element for a physical one. The bottom line is that the relation between physical element and analytical element can now be edited (in the old approach this was not possible) and the class which handles these relations is called AnalyticalToPhysicalAssociationManager. (edited)

Hello @Jeremy Tammik, I know that there should be an article about Analytical Model changes but I don't know if it's ready. I think that @Diane Christoforo should know more about this subject. (edited) 

Diane Christoforo  23 hours ago
Jeremy, I'm sorry for the delay - we are a few days out from publishing the 2023 API developers guide with the online help.

Jeremy Tammik  23 hours ago
Thank you for the good news, @Diane Christoforo! Can you point out the relevant items as soon as they appear, please? Thank you!

Jeremy Tammik  21 hours ago
So, is it correct to assume that the following code makes no sense at all any longer in Revit 2023 and needs to be completely rewritten:
  var am = wall.GetAnalyticalModel();

  foreach (var ct in CurveTypes)
  {
    var curves = am.GetCurves(ct);
    var n = curves.Count;

    Debug.Print("{0} {1} curve{2}.",
      n, ct, Util.PluralSuffix(n));

    foreach (var curve in curves)
      creator.CreateModelCurve(curve.CreateTransformed(T));
  }
There is no meaningful way to migrate it, since the basic concepts changed?

Diane Christoforo  19 hours ago
Yes, I will!

Romeo Belciug:spiral_calendar_pad:  7 hours ago
Hi related to the sample above, yes, most of the code must be rewritten.

Hello,
 
Yes, I think that the record can be public now (there are no changes related to API since the webinar).
 
We should put the pointer to the Developer Guide >> Structure section as well?  
Yes, that’s a good idea.
 
Thanks,
Romeo

Hi Romeo, Catalin, 
 
Now that Revit 2023 is out, would you like to make the recording public?  (Not sure if there is any change since the webinar, however.)

Please post to ADN extranet.  This webinar talks about 2023 release (next version) under NDA.  So we cannot post to publicly.

Caroline, we can mention the availability of recording to the newsletter.   (We also want to remind developers to look at preview release and report any issue soon. Next year will be too late for any serious change. Sasha was asking about it.)
