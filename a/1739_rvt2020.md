Happy Easter!
The post on <i>What's New in the Revit 2020 API</i> is overdue... for the time being, of course, you can refer to the documentation included with the Revit 2020 SDK, either <i>Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx</i> or the corresponding section in the help file <code>RevitAPI.chm</code>.
I promise you there is some really juicy stuff in there!

### RevitLookup and SDK for Revit 2020

Happy Easter!

I've been too busy in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) lately to
blog properly.

The post on *What's New in the Revit 2020 API* is overdue... for the time being, of course, you can refer to the documentation included with the Revit 2020 SDK, either *Revit Platform API Changes and Additions.docx* or the corresponding section in the help file `RevitAPI.chm`.

I promise you there is some really juicy stuff in there!

Here are some other quick notes anyway as an Easter present for you:

#### <a name="2"></a> RevitLookup for Revit 2020

I migrated [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) to Revit 2020.

No source code changes at all were required; I just updated the Revit API DLL assembly references and edited the readme file to
create [RevitLookup release 2020.0.0.0](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2020.0.0.0).

In addition, Harry Mattison of [Boost your BIM](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com) very
kindly provided a ready-built new installer in his post
on [RevitLookup for Revit 2020](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/revit-lookup-for-revit-2020), saying:

> I’ve added some conditional compilation and multiple configurations so that the single solution can be used to build against any version of Revit 2017-2020.

For manual installation, all releases are also provided as [pre-built versions generated by CI](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup#-builds)
at [lookupbuilds.com](https://lookupbuilds.com).


#### <a name="3"></a> Revit 2020 SDK posted

Last week, I described how
I [installed the Revit 2020 SDK](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html) from
the Revit 2020 installation `Setup.exe`
and [set up RvtSamples](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/04/the-revit-2020-fcs-api-and-sdk.html#8) for it.

Now, in addition, the Revit 2020 SDK has also been posted to
the [Revit developer centre public web page](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit),
so you can access it from there independently of the Revit product installation.


#### <a name="4"></a> Generative Design with Philippe Starck

Autodesk announced a
joint [collaboration of an algorithm with star designer Philippe Starck to create the first commercial product made using generative design](https://www.fastcompany.com/90334218/this-is-the-first-commercial-product-made-using-generative-design),
a chair that will soon go on sale:
