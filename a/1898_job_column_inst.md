- Intriguing new result from the LHCb experiment at CERN

  The LHCb results strengthen hints of a violation of lepton flavour universality
  LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaboration
  Today the LHCb experiment at CERN announced new results which, if confirmed, would suggest hints of a violation of the Standard Model of particle physics.
  
  [Standard Model](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model)
  The Standard Model explains how the basic building blocks of matter interact, governed by four fundamental forces.
  The theories and discoveries of thousands of physicists since the 1930s have resulted in a remarkable insight into the fundamental structure of matter: everything in the universe is found to be made from a few basic building blocks called fundamental particles, governed by four fundamental forces. Our best understanding of how these particles and three of the forces are related to each other is encapsulated in the Standard Model of particle physics. Developed in the early 1970s, it has successfully explained almost all experimental results and precisely predicted a wide variety of phenomena. Over time and through many experiments, the Standard Model has become established as a well-tested physics theory.
