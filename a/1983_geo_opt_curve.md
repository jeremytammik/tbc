Funny to get this very old post alive.
I'd change my answer from the time and say:
- sometimes the BoundarySegment list is holed (around windows and at the end of walls ending in the middle of the Room). So you have to close the List, practically we add another Segment to the List.
- check either Douglas Peucker or Visvaligham algorithms, easy to implement and very useful. At least that's what we use and these work fine for us.

####<a name="2"></a> Curve Loop Simplify and Clean Up

Benoit Favre, CEO of [etudes &amp; automates](http://www.etudesetautomates.com) shares
some interesting advice on how to simplify and clean up curve loops in 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread

I'd change my answer from the first time and now say:

  So, you have to close the gap; in practice, we add another segment to the list.

####<a name="3"></a> Geometry Options Clarification

The question on how to [find centroid of wall in Revit API](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/find-centroid-of-wall-in-revit-api/m-p/11748826)
provided an opportunity to clarify the meaning of specific settings in the geometry `Options` and the use of the `NewGeometryOptions` method:

- ComputeReferences
- IncludeNonVisibleObjects

[`ComputeReferences`](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/d7da6de4-74a9-60e2-826f-698a5730d0a8.htm) is 
only needed if you require references to the geometry, e.g., for dimensioning purposes. 
Furthermore, it adds computational effort. 
Therefore, you should not set it to true unless needed, as explained in the 2010 article 
on [Geometry Options](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/geometry-options.html).

The effect of turning off `ComputeReferences` was recently benchmarked in the discussion 
on [computing the correlation of objects in Revit](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/computing-the-correlation-of-objects-in-revit/m-p/11701329/highlight/true#M68810):

It includes the final code and the benchmark results:

PC specs:

- CPU: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400F @ 2.60GHz 2.59 GHz
- GPU: NVidia GeForce GTX 1650
- RAM: 32.0 GB
- OS: Windows 10 Pro 

The call to <i>BooleanOperationsUtils.ExecuteBooleanOperation(solidST, solidAR, BooleanOperationsType.Intersect)</i>
is triggered 113,696 times, both lists columnsSTR and columnsARC have 336 items each.

- Code runtime with `ComputeReferences` = true : 10.38 sec, AVG. 91.34 micro-seconds per intersection.
- Code runtime with `ComputeReferences` = false : 9.52 sec, AVG. 83.76 micro-seconds per intersection.

`IncludeNonVisibleObjects` is only required for certain supplementary graphical elements, e.g., 
for [curtain walls](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/05/curtain-wall-geometry.html).
I am pretty sure that it is not required for such basic element geometry as solids.

So, I would leave both of those settings turned off in this case, set to their default value of false.

Furthermore, I doubt that there is any difference between using `new Options` and `app.Create.NewGeometryOptions`. 

However, specifying a view argument in the options will definitely make a difference, depending on the view you supply. 
That can be achieved using both `new Options` and `app.Create.NewGeometryOptions`. 

####<a name="4"></a> JtClicker 2023

Jacopo Chiappetti of [One Team srl](https://www.oneteam.it) shared 
a new implementation of [JtClicker](https://github.com/jeremytammik/JtClicker) to
programmatically dismiss a UI warning message in the thread 
on [some annotations, schedules, view templates, filters, and views related to analytical elements might be modified or lost during the upgrade process](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/some-annotations-schedules-view-templates-filters-and-views/m-p/11721147):

**Question:** In Revit 2023, every time I open a model that contains at least one analytical element, a warning is displayed at the end of the process 
to [Upgrade the Analytical Model](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-E74EC52F-EFC6-4914-84B8-0119002A1C98): 
"Some annotations, schedules, view templates, filters, and views related to analytical elements might be modified or lost during the upgrade process."

This error window doesn't seem to be trappable by code (i.e., `Application_FailuresProcessing`) and blocks the automatic process of the model (custom code), after it is opened, until it's closed by the user. 
Is there a way to eliminate the message or intercept it somehow?

<img src="img/jc_error_msg.png" alt="JtClicker handles it" title="JtClicker handles it" width="349"/> <!-- 349 x 231 pixels -->
</center>

**Answer:** Yes, definitely. 
If worst comes to worst, you can use the native Windows API to catch and dismiss this dialogue. 
Look at the various options listed in The Building Coder topic group 
on [detecting and handling dialogues and failures](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.32).

**Response:** I cannot use `Application.FailuresProcessing` because it doesn't trap this warning.
Also, I cannot use `ControlledApplication.DialogBoxShowing`, as I use `IExternalDBApplication`, not `IExternalApplication`.
Hence, I have no access to any UI related functionality at all.
So, the only way seems using your JtClicker, isn't it? 

I gave 
the [.NET Dialogue Clicker in VB by Greg Wesner](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/10/dismiss-dialogue-using-windows-api.html) a 
try and it works with some small mods.

The loading process is slower, but finally I can trap the warning dialog and close it.

I really can't understand why this warning hasn't been included, along with all the others, in the `FailuresProcessing` event and no possibility is given to disable it: really disheartening.

**Answer:** If you are operating in an interactive session of Revit, you should be able to use IExternalApplication.
It is great to keep your code split validly between DB and UI levels; it allows the DB code to work with the APS Design Automation API.
In that case, you might need a specific small UI Application subscribing to and dismissing just this notice.
  
Is that feasible for you? 
Or is the JtClicker approach easier? 

**Response:** For many reasons, I prefer not to use UI, so it's easier to use the "JtClicker approach".
Here is my implementation; it's very similar to Greg's version:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  Public timer1 As Timer
  Public timer_interval As Integer = 1000  'millisecondi
  Public timer_attempts As Integer 'not used
  Public Const diagTitle As String = "Aggiornamento del modello analitico strutturale"
  Public Const diagButton As String = "&Chiudi"

  Public Function EnumWindowsProc(ByVal hwnd As Integer, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Boolean
    Dim sbTitle As New StringBuilder(256)
    Dim test As Integer = User32.GetWindowText(hwnd, sbTitle, sbTitle.Capacity)
    Dim title As String = sbTitle.ToString()
    If title.Length > 0 AndAlso title = diagTitle Then
      User32.EnumChildWindows(hwnd, New User32.EnumWindowsProc(AddressOf EnumChildProc), 0)
      Return False
    Else
      Return True
    End If
  End Function

  Public Function EnumChildProc(ByVal hwnd As Integer, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Boolean
    Dim sbTitle As New StringBuilder(256)
    User32.GetWindowText(hwnd, sbTitle, sbTitle.Capacity)
    Dim title As String = sbTitle.ToString()
    If title.Length > 0 AndAlso title = diagButton Then
      User32.SendMessage(hwnd, User32.BM_SETSTATE, 1, 0)
      User32.SendMessage(hwnd, User32.WM_LBUTTONDOWN, 0, 0)
      User32.SendMessage(hwnd, User32.WM_LBUTTONUP, 0, 0)
      User32.SendMessage(hwnd, User32.BM_SETSTATE, 1, 0)
      If Not timer1 Is Nothing Then
        timer1.Stop()
        timer1 = Nothing
      End If
      Return False
    Else
      Return True
    End If
  End Function

  Public Sub timer1_Elapsed(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)
    'If timer_attempts < 3000 Then
    User32.EnumWindows(New User32.EnumWindowsProc(AddressOf EnumWindowsProc), 0)
    'Else
    '  timer1.Stop()
    'End If
    'timer_attempts += 1
    'Debug.Print(timer_attempts.ToString())
  End Sub

  Public Sub closeOptionsDialog()
    timer_attempts = 0
    If timer1 Is Nothing Then
      timer1 = New Timer()
    End If
    timer1.Interval = timer_interval
    AddHandler timer1.Elapsed, New ElapsedEventHandler(AddressOf timer1_Elapsed)
    timer1.Start()
  End Sub
</pre> 

The `user32` module is identical:

<pre class="prettyprint">
Imports System
Imports System.Runtime.InteropServices
Imports System.Text

Module User32
  Delegate Function EnumWindowsProc(ByVal hWnd As Integer, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Boolean

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function FindWindow(ByVal className As String, ByVal windowName As String) As Integer
  End Function

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function EnumWindows(ByVal callbackFunc As EnumWindowsProc, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Integer
  End Function

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function EnumChildWindows(ByVal hwnd As Integer, ByVal callbackFunc As EnumWindowsProc, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Integer
  End Function

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function GetWindowText(ByVal hwnd As Integer, ByVal buff As StringBuilder, ByVal maxCount As Integer) As Integer
  End Function

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function GetLastActivePopup(ByVal hwnd As Integer) As Integer
  End Function

  <DllImport("user32.dll", CharSet:=CharSet.Unicode)>
  Function SendMessage(ByVal hwnd As Integer, ByVal Msg As Integer, ByVal wParam As Integer, ByVal lParam As Integer) As Integer
  End Function

  Public BM_SETSTATE As Integer = 243
  Public WM_LBUTTONDOWN As Integer = 513
  Public WM_LBUTTONUP As Integer = 514
End Module
</pre>
 
Many thanks to Jacopo for sharing his solution and thoughts on this!
