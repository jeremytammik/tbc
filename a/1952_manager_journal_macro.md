  > Journalysis is a Revit journal, worksharing log and keyboard shortcuts analysis package for the Dynamo visual programming environment.
  > Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not be entirely complete.
  > This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals and worksharing logs for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
  Monitor crashes
  Monitor API errors
  Monitor memory usage
  Monitor sync with central duration
  Keyboard shortcut usage

  Revit Addin Manager supports Debug/Trace Writeline include dockpanel for developer now.
  It's an improvement that i think it will save even more debugging time for programmers ðŸ¤—

  > Usually, when developing and debugging an addin with RevitAPI, user has to close & re-open Revit each time he/she modifies the addin code and wants to re-compile. But with Add-In Manager, user can modify and run the addin directly without closing & re-opening Revit again and again.
