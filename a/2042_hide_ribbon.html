<p>This  is a reposting of

</center></p>
<p>Does your application download Revit models from Autodesk/BIM 360 Docs, aka Revit Cloud Model or RCM?
If so, you are probably aware that the model is sometimes downloaded as ZIP.
This happens when a host model is linked to unpublished models.
It often causes confusion to both customers and application developers.</p>
<p>The Revit team is planning to change this behaviour and eliminate the ZIP.
Then, when downloading a host model, linked models will not be included.</p>
<p>For developers, the process of downloading a source file itself does not change.
However, this change might affect your application, depending on what it does.
Therefore, we would like to understand your use cases to avoid any possible disruption.</p>
<p>If you think this change might affect your application, are willing to share your use case scenarios and give us feedback, please contact us through:</p>

his comprehensive article on
<a href="https://chuongmep.com/posts/2024-04-19-reload-ribbon-revit.html#remove-panel">how to remove panel ribbon without restart Revit</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>
Is there an option in Revit 2025 to dynamically delete "PushButtonData" from the "RibbonPanel", or maybe hide it so that a new button can link to a new DLL?
Also, is it possible to create a "PushButtonData" from a DLL located in the resources of another DLL?
Is it generally required that at the time of creation or registration in the panel (before it is clicked and called), the DLL meets all the conditions (class name, location, etc.), or can it already be solved at the time of the call?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
This article explains, and points out how to resolve an issue with Private Dictionary to store RibbonItemDictionary;
you need do some tricks to remove panel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chuongmep.com/posts/2024-04-19-reload-ribbon-revit.html#remove-panel">How to remove panel ribbon without restart Revit</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Response:</strong>
Incredible job! Thank you very much! Added to bookmarks.</p>
<p>Can we get the name of the button, its description, or some kind of indicator after clicking it?</p>
<p>For example, I created one class MyCommand : IExternalCommand and registered it for several "PushButtonData" ("MyButtonOne", "MyButtonTwo").
After clicking on the button both times through the debugger, I will get to the same Execute() method of the MyCommand class.
In this case, is it possible to determine which of the buttons called this method?
Any way at all, even the most perverted...</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
You can do it with some step like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add assembly reference <code>AdWindows.dll</code></li>
<li>Add the event tracking user click on the button at <code>IExternalApplication</code> below</li>
<li>Call the action from external command matching the id returned from the event clicked</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-cs">using AW = Autodesk.Windows;

Autodesk.Windows.ComponentManager.UIElementActivated
  += RibbonUtils.ComponentManagerOnUIElementActivated;

public static void ComponentManagerOnUIElementActivated(
  object sender,
  AW.UIElementActivatedEventArgs e)
{
  try
  {
    var id = e.Item.Id;
    // match with id string contents here and save
    // after that match with all commands in your plugin
  }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong>
Thank you so much for the prompt response!
I think this is exactly what I need!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Chuong Ho for the comprehensive solution.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> EU Building Energy Performance Directive</h4>
<p>Some notes on the new EU ruling on the energy performance of buildings,
<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024L1275">Directive EU 2024/1275 of the European Parliament and of the Council</a> of 24 April 2024:</p>

<ul>
<li>New buildings must be net-zero by 2030</li>
<li>Existing buildings must be renovated to meet energy performance requirements</li>
<li>Building performance data to become more accessible, with improved funding</li>
<li>New incentives to deploy digital solutions, including building modeling and simulation</li>
</ul>
<p>Article 7, New buildings, states that member states shall ensure that new buildings are zero-emission buildings in accordance with Article 11
(a) from 1 January 2028, new buildings owned by public bodies; and
(b) from 1 January 2030, all new buildings.</p>
<p>Article 8 discusses existing buildings, Article 10, solar energy in buildings.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how these rulings pan out.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Stockholm Wood City</h4>
<p>In Scandinavia, wood is taking off in AEC.
For example, look at
the <a href="https://www.al.se/en/sickla">Stockholm Wood City</a> by Atrium Ljungberg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stockholm Wood City will be built in Sickla, an area in the south of the Swedish capital.

<h4><a name="6"></a> Bilinguals Get Dementia Later</h4>
<p>Personally, I am interested in human spoken languages as well as programming, and was happy to read
about some <a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/02/29/the-advantages-of-speaking-a-second-language">advantages of speaking a second language</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most notably, they have shown that bilinguals get dementia on average four years later than monolinguals, and that they have an edge in “executive control” &ndash; a basket of abilities that aid people doing complex tasks, including focusing attention, ignoring irrelevant information and updating working memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="7"></a> Language Speed And Information Density</h4>
<p>Another recent investigation looks at language speed and information density and discovers
the <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaw2594">different languages have similar encoding efficiency: comparable information rates across the human communicative niche</a>.</p>
