####<a name="6"></a> Using the New Unit API to Display Length of Multiple Lines

Another recent posts by Boost Your BIM discusses how to handle
the [Revit 2021 API Unit API changes](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2020/06/10/2021-changes-units)
by modifying an existing external command that calculates and displays 
the [total length of multiple lines](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/total-length-of-multiple-lines):

> Autodesk made a bunch of changes to the Revit API for Units in 2021.
  Many frequently-used methods are now marked as obsolete.
  They still work fine in 2021 but will probably be removed in 2022.
  For one example of how to update your code, this old sample computes the total length of all selected objects and shows the result as a formatted string.
  Here is the new code that uses the `UnitFormatUtils` method `Format` taking `Units`, `ForgeTypeId`, `Double` and `Boolean` input arguments...

####<a name="8"></a> Intro to Synchronous versus Async Programming

Let's end for today with this very nice explanation of synchronous versus async programming:
[how do I think about async code?!](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/how-do-i-think-about-async-code)

Take care.
