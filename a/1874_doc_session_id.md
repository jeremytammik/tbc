- vendor id
  Where do I register a Vendor ID for use in Revit .addin files?
Q: For what seems like a looong time ago (> 15 years) I registered a Vendor ID for my previous employer Cad Quality AB in Sweden. Now I am trying to do the same for my new employer Tribia AB, but I cannot find any page on ADN or Autodesk websites for doing so.
Are the Vendor ID:s still in use, and if so – where can I register a new ID?
A: This vendor id is no longer in use.
The recommended vendor id to use in a Revit add-in manifest file is your reversed internet url, afaik.
For example, i use:
    <VendorId>com.typepad.thebuildingcoder</VendorId>
    <VendorDescription>The Building Coder, http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com</VendorDescription>

1. Small individual bias &rarr; Large collective bias.
When someone says a culture is shapist, they're not saying the individuals in it are shapist. They're not attacking you personally.

2. The past haunts the present.
Your bedroom floor doesn't stop being dirty just coz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet. Creating equality is like staying clean: it takes work. And it's always a work in progress.

3. Demand diversity near you.
If small biases created the mess we're in, small anti-biases might fix it. Look around you. Your friends, your colleagues, that conference you're attending. If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life - that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.

For a nice little demonstration of the subtle influence various individual preferences and prejudice can have on collective behaviour, check out
the [Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons), a segregation simulation that clearly proves certain points:

1. Small individual bias &rarr; Large collective bias.
<br/>When someone says a culture is shapist, they're not saying the individuals in it are shapist. They're not attacking you personally.
2. The past haunts the present.
<br/>Your bedroom floor doesn't stop being dirty just coz you stopped dropping food all over the carpet. Creating equality is like staying clean: it takes work. And it's always a work in progress.
3. Demand diversity near you.
<br/>If small biases created the mess we're in, small anti-biases might fix it. Look around you. Your friends, your colleagues, that conference you're attending. If you're all triangles, you're missing out on some amazing squares in your life - that's unfair to everyone. Reach out, beyond your immediate neighbors.
