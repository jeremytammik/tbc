- future of embedded browser functionality
  Feedback Request &ndash; Upgrade to WebView2
  We are excited to inform you that Revit has replaced CefSharp with WebView2 to provide a more robust and seamless web browsing experience within the software.
  Why the change?
  WebView2 is a web control provided by Microsoft Edge (Chromium) that allows developers to host web content in native applications. It offers better performance, compatibility, and support compared to the previously used CefSharp. This ensures consistent rendering across all Windows devices, improved security, and the ability to use the latest web technologies.
  What does this mean for you?
  The transition to WebView2 is designed to be as seamless as possible. However, as with any significant change, there may be minor adjustments. We kindly ask you to test if all the existing features work fine as usual.
  How can you help?
  Please spend some time using Revit as you normally would, and pay particular attention to any features that use web content. If you encounter any issues or notice any changes in functionality, we would greatly appreciate your feedback.
  We thank you in advance for testing this enhancement!

####<a name="3"></a> CefSharp versus WebView2 Embedded Browser

Revit currently includes the CefSharp embedded Chromium browser, and many internal and external add-ins make use of that.
Another option for Chromium embedding is provided by WebView2, and some add-ins already use that instead.
This StackOverflow question provides a comparison
of [CefSharp vs WebView2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70360189/cefsharp-vs-webview2).
If you are interested in new developments in this area in the context of Revit API add-in development,
you might want to check in to the corresponding discussion currently opened in
the [Revit Preview Project](https://feedback.autodesk.com/key/LHMJFVHGJK085G2M).

####<a name="4"></a> Twentytwo

[Twentytwo](https://twentytwo.space), written by Min Naung, provides a place and resources for BIM Programming enthusiasts.
Quite a while ago, I already mentioned
the [TwentyTwo add-ins and tutorials](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/10/element-level-and-ifc-properties-.html#2).
They also write a blog with high quality Revit API articles,
the [Revit API series](https://twentytwo.space/revit-api-series/).

One of them, for instance,
on [schedule creation](https://twentytwo.space/2021/05/02/revit-api-schedule-creation/),
recently came in useful and helped solve the question
on [sort/grouping field in schedule](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/sort-grouping-field-in-schedule/m-p/12869665).

Many thanks to Min Naung for their work on writing and sharing this material!

####<a name="5"></a> Ugrep Enhanced Grep

I use `grep` a lot in my everyday work, searching for text in text files.
With `ugrep`, this workflow can be easily expanded to cover all kinds of file formats and directory structures,
cf. [The ugrep file pattern searcher](https://ugrep.com), with
its [ugrep GitHub repo](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep).

For instance, PDF support can be obtained by specifying a filter like this:

<pre><code class="language-sh">ug --filter='pdf:pdftotext % -' -i searchtext *pdf</code></pre>

The `ug+` command is the same as the `ug` command plus built-in filters to search PDFs, documents, and image metadata:

<pre><code class="language-sh">ug+ -i searchtext *pdf</code></pre>

Fuzzy search is also supported, among tons of other features:

<pre><code class="language-sh">ug+ -Z -i searchtext *pdf</code></pre>

Mark Bishop wrote critical article stating
that [artificial intelligence is stupid and causal reasoning will not fix it](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.513474/full),
also presented as a 90-minute video
