Furthermore, I am preparing for the [Forge DevCon](http://forge.autodesk.com/conference) in San Francisco next month.

As if that was not enough, on Wednesday, I am also participating in the worldwide [Autodesk Answer day](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/autodeskhelp/autodesk-answer-day-may-18th-2016/ba-p/6277390), taking place from 6am to 6pm Pacific Time.

This one will be the biggest yet, focusing on seven products: 3ds Max, AutoCAD, Civil3D, Inventor, Maya, Revit, and Vault.

Here is [Kean's description](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/05/ask-me-anything-at-next-weeks-autodesk-answer-day.html) of
this event, his participation in it, and his take
on [where Autodesk is heading and how Forge fits in to that](http://through-the-interface.typepad.com/through_the_interface/2016/04/stoking-the-forge.html).

Looking forward to hearing from you!
