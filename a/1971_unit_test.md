### Unit Test Your Revit Add-In

Finally, after almost a week of serious disruption on the Typepad blogging platform hosting The Building Coder, I am back with a new post.

If any similar hiccups crop up in the fiuture, please be aware that The Building Coder is also available directly on GitHub pages in the [`tbc` repostitory](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc) hosting the source and chronological index for The Building Coder Revit API blog.
It includes all the markdown source text, HTML, CSS and images for The Building Coder, plus the cmplete chronological index of all posts.
Besides providing a workaround for Typepad failure, it also enables you to grab all The Building Coder source text, host it locally, and use it to implemet your own search algorithms or even train your AI to answer Revit API questions.

As I explained in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
about [The Building Coder blog standalone](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/the-building-coder-blog-standalone/td-p/11519594):

> You can continue reading all blog posts by The Building Coder on GitHub in the [`tbc` repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc).
All articles are published there as well, including their source text.
The Building Coder standalone boasts a [global chronological blog post index ](http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a).
Here is the blog post describing how I started the `tbc` repository in 2016:

Quick reminder on behalf of Jaime:
we are planning an accelerator in the Autodesk Dublin Office this upcoming November 14thto 18th.
We are looking for customers interested in joining us onsite to work with the Developer advocates team in coding solutions using Autodesk Platform Services (formerly Forge).
In the past (pre-covid), we regularly hosted such events in the EMEA region to have software developers join us for the week.
We have an ongoing registration and would love to have a full house for the event:

####<a name="4"></a> Learning Revit API as a Complete Beginner

Back to the Revit API, we once again provide
some [advice about learning Revit API as a complete beginner](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/advice-about-learning-api-forum-as-a-complete-beginer/m-p/11522223):

**Question:** I was recently informed by my organization that I need to start working with the Revit API.
I know how to use Revit quite well and Dynamo also I have a good experience with it.
However, I have no experience at all considering that I don't know anything about C# language or forums.
Here are my questions:

- What is the best way to learn in this case? 
- Where can I ask and find information?
- How much usually is time to learn such process?
- Do I need to learn the whole C# language or just the Revit Api? 

I'd appreciate any help with where to start learning and what to do

**Answer:** Welcome to the Revit API!

Normally, I would point you to
The Building Coder [tips on getting started](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).

Unfortunately, the Typepad blog host platform is currently having serious problems, so take a look at
the [GitHub source code of The Building Coder blog](http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a/#2) instead.

It answers all you questions in depth, possibly except about time. Still, I'll briefly reiterate:

- What is the best way to learn in this case?

Start by exploring the Revit UI. You already have. Gain some basic understanding of .NET and C#, of you plan to work in C#. That should be doable in a couple of hours or a couple of days, depending on you. Then, work through the Revit API getting started material. There are walkthroughs, video tutorials, numerous YouTube introductions, hundreds of options. Many have been mentioned and discussed here in the forum in the past.

- Where can I ask and find information?

Please work through the getting started material before asking any questions. If you encounter problems with the getting started material, please search for existing answers. I guarantee that you will not have a problem that has not already been discussed and solved here in the past.

- How much usually is time to learn such process?

Days, weeks, and years. Depends how far you wish to go. A proficient programmer can understand the system and have a non-trivial macro up and running within hours.

- Do I need to learn the whole C# language or just the Revit Api?

There is no good way to use half a programming language.
You have to learn and understand the entire .NET environment.
That can be programmed in C# or in other languages as well.

All of this information has been presented hundreds of times in the past, so please search thoroughly for answers before raising any new questions.

Thank you! Good luck and have fun!

####<a name="5"></a> Retrieving All Fabrication Item Materials

We all know how hard it can be to read the documentation, and how utterly unknown some of the information it contains still remains, in spite of being documented.
A case at hand came up in the question
on [how to get all materials (of fabrication items) possible in the database](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-get-all-materials-of-fabrication-item-possible-in-the/td-p/11509305):

**Question:** 
I want to get all the fabrication material name and their group's name,

As I want to create a setting where the users may select material-based action.

Currently I'm only able to get the materials that are used in Placed FabricationPart instance via 
the below mentioned code:

var allFabParts = new FilteredElementCollector(document).OfClass(typeof(FabricationPart)).Cast<FabricationPart>();
FabricationConfiguration fabConfig = FabricationConfiguration.GetFabricationConfiguration(document);
var materialDetails = allFabParts.SelectMany(x => fabConfig.GetAllMaterials(x))
                .Select(x => new { MatName = fabConfig.GetMaterialName(x), MatGroup = fabConfig.GetMaterialGroup(x) });

**Answer:** Where and how do you see the desired materials in the end user interface?

Can you use RevitLookup to snoop the database to find the corresponding storage location API access?

Here are some previous articles on API interaction with materials:

https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.5

Are the materials you are after included when you use a filtered element collector to retrieve all Material elements? If so, then all you need to do is discover the criteria that mark them for usage in fabrication parts.

**Response:** The UI will be quite simple where the user will choose the fabrication material name (which the user will see from fabrication CADmep).

I can't filter fabrication materials from filter element collector as the aren't elements.
I have gone through the posts I didn't find what I was looking for.

This is fabrication material I'm talking about.
Like in the below image the "Material" id is "4",
by this integer number I can query in the fabrication configuration to get further info about the fabrication material like it's name the group name to which the material belongs to etc.

Currently I'm only able to get this material ids (Not Revit Materials) from the placed fabrication instances only, I wanted to know if there is a way to get all the possible fabrication material ids without placing any FabricationPart instance.

<img src="img/fabrication_part_material.png" alt="Fabrication part material" title="Fabrication part material" width="100"/>  <!-- 802 x 524 -->
</center>


**Answer:** 
Unfortunately, the only way is to get the property from the existing elements.
  
Sorry for the bad news and that this functionality is not currently available. You could submit a wish for it to the Revit Idea Station:

Whenever you require a new or enhanced Revit product or Revit API functionality, the Revit Idea Station is the place to go.

Please search there for a corresponding wish list entry for the suggested functionality and add your comments to it, or create a new one, if none already exists:

https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-ideas/idb-p/302

Tag it as an API wish:

https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-ideas/idb-p/302/tab/most-recent/label-name/api

Ensuring that a wish gets as many votes as possible helps underline its importance to you and the rest of the developer community.

The Revit Idea Station is currently one of the main driving input forces for Revit API enhancements.

The Revit development team looks there. Your comment here in the discussion forum might be overlooked.

**Answer 2:** The documentation for FabricationConfiguration.GetAllMaterials() says "If a part is passed, only returns materials which are valid for the part, otherwise returns all materials." Does it return all materials if you pass it null?

**Response:** 
Yes, it's returning a lot of material ids if provided 'null' - FabricationConfiguration.GetAllMaterials(null) and hopefully these are all the materials available.
Feeling like, how did I miss it out... 🤔

Thanks a lot for pointing it out.

**Answer:** Wow! Thank you very much for the observation and confirmation. It just goes to show, yet again, how hard it is to read the documentation, really grasp everything it tells us, and how unknown the information it contains, even to the development team itself.

Many thanks to Matthew [mhannonQ65N2](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/8377999) Hannon for his careful reading of the documentation!
