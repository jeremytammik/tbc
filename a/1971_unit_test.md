### Unit Test Your Revit Add-In

Finally, after almost a week of serious disruption on the Typepad blogging platform hosting The Building Coder, I am back with a new post.

If any similar hiccups crop up in the fiuture, please be aware that The Building Coder is also available directly on GitHub pages in the [`tbc` repostitory](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc) hosting the source and chronological index for The Building Coder Revit API blog.
It includes all the markdown source text, HTML, CSS and images for The Building Coder, plus the cmplete chronological index of all posts.
Besides providing a workaround for Typepad failure, it also enables you to grab all The Building Coder source text, host it locally, and use it to implemet your own search algorithms or even train your AI to answer Revit API questions.

As I explained in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
about [The Building Coder blog standalone](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/the-building-coder-blog-standalone/td-p/11519594):

> You can continue reading all blog posts by The Building Coder on GitHub in the [`tbc` repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc).
All articles are published there as well, including their source text.
The Building Coder standalone boasts a [global chronological blog post index ](http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a).
Here is the blog post describing how I started the `tbc` repository in 2016:

####<a name="2"></a> APS (ex-Forge) Accelerator Dublin Nov 14-18

Quick reminder on behalf of Jaime:
we are planning an accelerator in the Autodesk Dublin Office this upcoming November 14thto 18th.
We are looking for customers interested in joining us onsite to work with the Developer advocates team in coding solutions using Autodesk Platform Services (formerly Forge).
In the past (pre-covid), we regularly hosted such events in the EMEA region to have software developers join us for the week.
We have an ongoing registration and would love to have a full house for the event:

####<a name="4"></a> Learning Revit API as a Complete Beginner

Back to the Revit API, we once again provide
some [advice about learning Revit API as a complete beginner](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/advice-about-learning-api-forum-as-a-complete-beginer/m-p/11522223):

**Question:** I was recently informed by my organization that I need to start working with the Revit API.
I know how to use Revit quite well and Dynamo also I have a good experience with it.
However, I have no experience at all considering that I don't know anything about C# language or forums.
Here are my questions:

- What is the best way to learn in this case? 
- Where can I ask and find information?
- How much usually is time to learn such process?
- Do I need to learn the whole C# language or just the Revit Api? 

I'd appreciate any help with where to start learning and what to do

**Answer:** Welcome to the Revit API!

Normally, I would point you to
The Building Coder [tips on getting started](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#2).

Unfortunately, the Typepad blog host platform is currently having serious problems, so take a look at
the [GitHub source code of The Building Coder blog](http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a/#2) instead.

It answers all you questions in depth, possibly except about time. Still, I'll briefly reiterate:

- What is the best way to learn in this case?

Start by exploring the Revit UI. You already have. Gain some basic understanding of .NET and C#, of you plan to work in C#. That should be doable in a couple of hours or a couple of days, depending on you. Then, work through the Revit API getting started material. There are walkthroughs, video tutorials, numerous YouTube introductions, hundreds of options. Many have been mentioned and discussed here in the forum in the past.

- Where can I ask and find information?

Please work through the getting started material before asking any questions. If you encounter problems with the getting started material, please search for existing answers. I guarantee that you will not have a problem that has not already been discussed and solved here in the past.

- How much usually is time to learn such process?

Days, weeks, and years. Depends how far you wish to go. A proficient programmer can understand the system and have a non-trivial macro up and running within hours.

- Do I need to learn the whole C# language or just the Revit Api?

There is no good way to use half a programming language.
You have to learn and understand the entire .NET environment.
That can be programmed in C# or in other languages as well.

All of this information has been presented hundreds of times in the past, so please search thoroughly for answers before raising any new questions.

Thank you! Good luck and have fun!
