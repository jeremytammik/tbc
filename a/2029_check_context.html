  I am excited to announce a significant development in data interaction and retrieval processes using Autodesk Platform Services from Autodesk. Today, I am officially releasing the first version of a toolkit designed to facilitate data access, aiming to support AI processes, Data Analysts, LLM, and explore the boundaries where APS may fall short in providing for end-users.
  This toolkit is open-source, ensuring accessibility to all engineers, BIM developers, and data scientists. I am actively working on refining it further. Please feel free to provide any feedback in the comments below this post, and I will consider all suggestions.

Chuong could replace me several times over.

I suspect he is pretty busy with his own projects, though:

The blog post is cleaned now.

Hi Jeremy,

No, this is the first time I have heard about him. That is good to know as Mikako needs to look for your replacement 😉

Dear Cyrille,

yes, sure, i'll do that right away.

sorry, i was not aware of that.

Chuong Ho is an incredibly active and highly competent Revit API community contributor, by the way.

i guess he is in the APS scene as well, and that you are aware of that?

cheers

Hi Jeremy,

Would you mind removing any reference to the APS toolkit from this blog article?

https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/03/api-context-aps-toolkit-and-da4r-debugging.html

The APS Toolkit explains the internal SVF format and how to download it locally. While it is technically possible, and I usually tell people how to do it, we want to promote something other than this. Putting it on your blog makes it highly visible and indicates Autodesk supports it, and, as an Autodesk employee with lots of readers, encourages people to do it.

<blockquote>
<p>Revit API throws exceptions if your code is trying to execute Revit API methods in a modeless context, e.g., a WPF modeless view; that's the reason you need to use <code>ExternalEvent</code> to execute Revit API code in context.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to know whether code is running in context or if not, to just execute the Revit API code right away or send it to ExternalEvent to be executed.</p>
<p>If you have access to <code>UIApplication</code> or <code>UIControllerApplication</code>, and if you try to subscribe to an event outside Revit API context, you are gonna have this exception: Invalid call to Revit API! Revit is currently not within an API context.</p>
<p>Meaning: you can use that to know if your code is in context or not.</p>

####<a name="5"></a> APS Toolkit

In the last post,
I mentioned [Chuong Ho](https://chuongmep.com/)'s
[BIM interactive notebooks](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/02/interactive-bim-notebook-temporary-graphics-and-ai.html#2).

Now you can see how he put them to use in his newest project,
the [APS Toolkit](https://github.com/chuongmep/aps-toolkit):

> I am excited to announce a significant development in data interaction and retrieval processes using Autodesk Platform Services from Autodesk. Today, I am officially releasing the first version of a toolkit designed to facilitate data access, aiming to support AI processes, Data Analysts, LLM, and explore the boundaries where APS may fall short in providing for end-users.
This toolkit is open source, ensuring accessibility to all engineers, BIM developers, and data scientists. I am actively working on refining it further. Please feel free to provide any feedback in the comments below this post, and I will consider all suggestions.

[APS Toolkit](https://github.com/chuongmep/aps-toolkit) empowers you to explore the Autodesk Platform Services APS.
It's built on top of [Autodesk.Forge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Forge/)
and [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/).
The toolkit includes features enabling you to read, download and write data from APS and export to CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, etc.

Features:

- Read/Download SVF Model
- Read/Query Properties Database SQLite
- Read/Download Properties Without Viewer
- Read Geometry Data
- Read Metadata
- Read Fragments
- Read MeshPacks
- Read Images
- Export Data to CSV
- Export Data to Excel
- Export Data to Parquet

Sample usage to export Revit Data To Excel using .NET C&#35;:

<pre><code class="language-csharp">using APSToolkit;
using Autodesk.Forge;
using APSToolkit.Database;
using APSToolkit.Auth;
var token = Authentication.Get2LeggedToken().Result;
string urn = "dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5maWxlOnZmLk9kOHR4RGJLU1NlbFRvVmcxb2MxVkE_dmVyc2lvbj0z";
var RevitPropDbReader = new PropDbReaderRevit(urn, token);
RevitPropDbReader.ExportAllDataToExcel("result.xlsx");
</code></pre>

Sample usage to export Revit Data To Excel using Python:

<pre><code class="language-python">from aps_toolkit import Auth
from aps_toolkit import PropDbReaderRevit
auth = Auth()
token = auth.auth2leg()
urn = "dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5maWxlOnZmLk9kOHR4RGJLU1NlbFRvVmcxb2MxVkE_dmVyc2lvbj0z"
prop_reader = PropDbReaderRevit(urn, token)
df = prop_reader.get_data_by_category("Ducts")
df.save_to_excel("result.xlsx")
</code></pre>

Many thanks to Chuong Ho for creating and sharing this powerful toolkit!
