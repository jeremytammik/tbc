### Revit 2024.2 Update

####<a name="2"></a> Autodesk Revit 2024.2 Update

[Autodesk Revit 2024.2 is now available](https://blogs.autodesk.com/aec/2023/11/08/revit-2024-2-is-now-available/).

2024.2 is compatible with the previous 2024.1.1 update and can be used together with it on project work.

The 2024.1.1 and 2024.2 updates are especially important for work-sharing users.
In such a context, all project team members should be using at least these releases of Revit or higher to avoid
the [extensible storage schema conflicts in Revit 2024](#3)
described below.

Othe API-related enhancement include:

- Fixed an issue in which API function Parameter.Definition.GetDataType().TypeId returned obsolete specs (spec schemas that inherit from the obsolete base specs "autodesk.spec:spec.int64-1.0.0", "autodesk.spec:spec.measurable-1.0.0", and "autodesk.spec:spec.string-1.0.0".)
- Added an API for adding points (plural) on SlabShapeEditor
- Fixed an issue when an element with Entity attached is operated by a user in an upgraded file and a previous version file is opened in the same session containing the same schema, cf. [below](#3)
- MEP Electrical Circuits: Improved the API ElectricalSystem.Create() to make it use the voltage of the first matched connector when creating an electrical system with the connectors whose voltages were mapped to an instance parameter, cf. ricaun's comment on the Revit API forum discussion thread
on [NewElectricalSystem specify voltage and poles](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/newelectricalsystem-specify-voltage-amp-poles/m-p/12366308#M75140) &ndash; thank you, Luiz!
- Dynamo for Revit: Upgraded Dynamo Core version to 2.19.3. Please refer to
the [DynamoDS 2.19 release notes](https://github.com/DynamoDS/Dynamo/wiki/Release-Notes#219) for more details

Non-API-related enhancements cover Area Plans, Data Analytics, Design Option, Edit, Materials, Properties Dialog, UI Frameworks, Worksharing, Energy &ndash; Analytical Model and MEP Fabrication + Analytical Systems + Electrical Analytical + Electrical Circuits.

####<a name="3"></a> Extensible Storage Schema Conflicts in Revit 2024

One issues of high importance resolved by Revit 2024.2 and especially related to the Revit API addresses an extensible storage schema issue affecting addons and projects that are upgraded for Revit 2024.

The 2024.1.1 and 2024.2 updates are especially important for work-sharing users.
In such a context, all project team members should be using at least these releases of Revit or higher to avoid the possibility of older versions of Revit 2024 reintroducing schema problems back to the project models.
To learn more about this issue, please refer to the support article
