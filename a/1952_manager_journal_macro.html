- add-in manager Debug Trace
  Chuong Ho
  Revit add-in manager supports Debug/Trace Writeline include dockpanel for developer now.
  It's an improvement that i think it will save even more debugging time for programmers ðŸ¤—

  > Usually, when developing and debugging an addin with RevitAPI, user has to close & re-open Revit each time he/she modifies the addin code and wants to re-compile. But with Add-In Manager, user can modify and run the addin directly without closing & re-opening Revit again and again.

  > Journalysis is a Revit journal, worksharing log and keyboard shortcuts analysis package for the Dynamo visual programming environment.
  > Since there is hardly any documentation on Revit journals, it is a slow process. I have started writing some documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis/wiki) that may, however, not be entirely complete.
  > This package is aimed at automating the analysis of Revit journals and worksharing logs for statistical purposes. Some possible use cases:
  Monitor crashes
  Monitor API errors
  Monitor memory usage
  Monitor sync with central duration
  Keyboard shortcut usage

<h4><a name="2"></a> Revit Macro Study Shareback</h4>
<p>We recently
asked for feedback from the add-in developer community in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/research-how-do-you-use-revit-macros/m-p/11158305">how you use Revit Macros</a>.</p>
<p>The results are now in, and we share them with you for further evaluation and feedback:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feel free to review the research result summary and add any comments or suggestions at: </p>
<p><center><a href="https://www.autodeskresearchcommunity.com/hub/posts/post-25914628">Revit Macro Study Shareback</a></center></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to set up an account with Autodesk research, fill in a survey and await the response email to see them.</p>
<p>To save others the same process, time and effort, I took the liberty of printing the results to PDF and sharing them here in <a href="zip/revit_macro_study_shareback.pdf">revit_macro_study_shareback.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to the Revit development team and Siyu Guo for the shareback and interesting results.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Add-In Manager with Debug Trace</h4>
<p>We recently mentioned
Chuong Ho's <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/01/add-in-manager-formulamanager-and-tiger-year.html#2">open source add-in manager</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, when developing and debugging an add-in with Revit API, user has to recompile, close and reopen Revit each time they modify the add-in code. 
With Add-In Manager, you can modify and run the add-in directly without closing and reopening Revit again and again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chuong announces new enhancements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revit Add-in Manager supports Debug/Trace WriteLine including a dockable panel now.

<p>By the way, for the sake of completeness, note that
the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload">.NET hot reload for editing code at runtime</a>
in Visual Studio 2019 also enables you to update your add-in code on the fly, cf.

<h4><a name="4"></a> Journal File Analysis</h4>
<p>I happened to notice
Andreas <a href="https://github.com/andydandy74">@andydandy74</a> Dieckmann's
interesting Python and Dynamo project <a href="https://github.com/andydandy74/Journalysis">Journalysis</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Journalysis is a Revit journal, worksharing log and keyboard shortcuts analysis package for the Dynamo visual programming environment.

<h4><a name="5"></a> Plugging the HSL Colour Format</h4>
<p>Unrelated to the Revit API, I found the 7-minute video explaining and motivating us 
to <a href="https://youtu.be/VInSzHOeFkE">switch to HSL colour format</a> very interesting and informative:</p>
