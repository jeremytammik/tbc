<h3>Apply Code Changes</h3>
<h4><a name="2"></a></h4>
<p>Chris Hildebran pointed out that 'Apply code changes' now works when debugging and editing a Revit add-in:</p>
<p>I'm writing as a result of a discovery I saw in Visual Studio today.
That discovery is the 'Apply Code Changes' button located to the right of the Start/Continue button:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/apply_code_changes.png" alt="Apply code changes" title="Apply code changes" width="348"/> <!-- 348 -->
</center></p>
<p>I gather it has been available for C++ for quite a while but just recently for .NET projects as of Visual Studio Version 16.11.0 Preview 1.0.</p>
<p>While debugging, I thought id see if this would work in Revit Addin Development.</p>
<p>Initial testing confirmed that it does indeed apply code changes which can be seen in a video demonstrating the modification of an add-in tool I'm working on &ndash; in C# at least; Need to test <code>.xaml</code>.</p>
<p>I've recorded a <a href="https://www.screencast.com/t/5oCj1jBJha">two-minute video</a> demonstrating the initial test, which I hope is clear enough to see.</p>
<p>I had planned to implement a solution Josh Lumley proposed, but if this continues to work, I will continue using this feature to drastically speed up development.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm late to the party, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.</p>
<p>Here is
the Microsoft article <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-hot-reload">introducing the .NET Hot Reload experience for editing code at runtime</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Chris for sharing this!</p>
<p>For completeness, The Building Coder topic group
on <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.49">debuging without restart and live development</a> discusses
how 'Edit and Continue' used to work way back in Revit 2008 and various other solutions suggested in the meantime.</p>
