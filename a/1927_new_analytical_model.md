  New API Analytical Model
  New API to enable direct control of the structural analytical model that allows developers to operate independently the creation and modification of analytical elements, offering simplified implementations that work in abstraction from physical elements.

  It would be nice to remove this filter and replace ids.Any() with ids.Count > 0. This will improve performance as Any creates a new Enumerator
  Regarding performance, code readability and semantic meaning are more important than performance in places where performance does not matter.
  I agree that sometimes code readability is more important, but in this case additional lines or conditions are not added. And here is the difference in speed 1200 times with memory allocation = (

  wow, impressive! thank you for the conclusive benchmark. i'll add a note of that result to the blog, i think.

### New Analytical Model API

####<a name="2"></a> New Analytical Model API

We have just added a new item to
the [Revit Public Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/ldRXK9Gw/revit-public-roadmap) announcing
a new API for analytical modelling in Revit.
This is quite an evolution (if not revolution, as the old one will be deprecated).
Please take a close look at it if you are interested in this area.

> **New API Analytical Model**

> New API to enable direct control of the structural analytical model that allows developers to operate independently the creation and modification of analytical elements, offering simplified implementations that work in abstraction from physical elements.
