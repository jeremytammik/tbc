  Awesome job! Thank you for your contributions!
  I really like the winui style wpf windows. I tried to achieve a similar result for my project, but failed. I'll dive into into the code, but if you can recommend any guides and tweaks to get a basic winui style window displayed in Revit, that would save me a ton of brainwork. 😅

  Thank you, I'm very pleased) The easiest way is to copy the UI project from RevitLookup. You will not be able to use the original winui project because it is tied to the use of the static Appication.Current property, which is not available for the dll applications that are used in Revit.
  In addition, you should not forget to add the manifest file to your application)

  There are probably no manuals, just learning the code 😉
  Using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting.Host is optional, you can create a regular window, new FluentWindow() and call the ShowDialog() method, if you tell me what fails you, I can give more information)

  Thanks for the tip. Tried the Host way as well, but it just starts to get so dependent on RevitLookup classes like Host and IWindow, that I gave up. Alternatively newing up the FluentWindow and calling ShowDialog() throws when trying to remove the backdrop. Do you have any quick tips? If not, don't worry, it's not so vital.

  The documentation used to be here https://wpfui.lepo.co/documentation/, unfortunately it is not available nowTry running this project on your computer and learn how it works
  gaborschnierer
  Yea, I'll build it from ground up when I get the chance. Thanks! 🙏

- Revit API training
  Q Do you teach or have you ever taught Revit in an online mode? I could use that.
  A We used to teach face-to-face courses and published the material on GitHub:

  https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra
  I never did online. I know Harry Mattison did:
