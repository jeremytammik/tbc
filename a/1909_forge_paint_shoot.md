- paint stairs
  [Paint Stair Faces](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/paint-stair-faces/m-p/10388359)
  solved by Bruce [@canyon.des[(https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/10032309) Hans
  [Q] Is there any reason why stair faces can be painted in the UI, and not in the API? The question was raised in 2015 and apparently still exists:
  I'm trying to paint some of the faces of a stair (a monolithic stair) through the 2015 revit API. It appears that it cannot be done programmatically (i get an error message that "the element faces cannot be painted") even if i can do this stair face painting manually in revit. Is there a way to paint automatically those faces? An excerpt of my code below. 
  [A] For stairs, you need to use `GetStairsLandings` and `GetStairsRuns` to get the `ElementId` to paint landings or runs. It's not intuitive but works. It's the same to find out whether the landing or run faces are painted or not.
  Thx

Doom on an IKEA TRÅDFRI lamp!
https://youtu.be/7ybybf4tJWw
> We ported Doom to the Silicon lab's MGM210L RF module found ni the IKEA TRÅDFRI RGB GU10 lamp (IKEA model: LED1923R5). 
The module has only 108 kB of RAM so we had to optimize a lot the RAM usage. 
The module has only 1 MB of internal flash, therefore we added an external SPI flash to store the WAD file, which can be uploaded using YMODEM.
The display is a cheap and widespread 160x128 16bpp, 1.8" TFT.
