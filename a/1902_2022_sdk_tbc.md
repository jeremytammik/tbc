### Revit 2022 SDK and The Building Coder Samples

The Revit 2022 SDK is now available for download from
the [Revit Developer Centre, autodesk.com/developrevit](https://www.autodesk.com/developer-network/platform-technologies/revit).

I logged my experiences installing and compiling it, setting up the RvtSamples application to load all the SDK external commands, and migrating The Building Coder samples to the new release:


####<a name="2"></a> First the Logs

In reality, I migrated RevitLookup first, then The Building Coder samples, and last I installed the SDK and set up RvtSamples.
Here are my log files of error, warnings and WIP notes in that order:

- [RevitLookup](zip/revit_2022_revitlookup_errors_warnings_0.txt)
- [The Building Coder samples](zip/tbc_samples_2022_migr_01.txt)
- [Revit 2022 SDK and RvtSamples](zip/revit_2022_sdk_samples_errors_warnings_1.txt)

Let's look at the SDK installation first, though:

####<a name="2"></a> Revit 2022 SDK Warnings

I loaded the `SDKSamples.sln` solution file and was glad to note that the Reevit API assembly references were all set up and ready to go.
The compilation succeeded out of the box and all 196 projects completed.
The compilation generated 49 warnings.

Most of the warnings concern the
ever-recurring [architecture mismatch issue](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/06/processor-architecture-mismatch-warning.html)
and can be resolved using
my [DisableMismatchWarning.exe utility](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/07/recursively-disable-architecture-mismatch-warning.html)
implemented back in 2013 and available from
the [DisableMismatchWarning GitHub repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/DisableMismatchWarning).

After fixing those, only seven warnings remain;
two were due to missing XML documentation comments, and three missing rule sets. 
I added two trivial documentation comments and deleted a reference to one of the rule sets.

In the end, four warnings remain that I will ignore for now;
actually, I don't even know what is casuing them or how they could be fixed:

- GeometryCreation_BooleanOperation: Could not find rule set file "GeometryCreation_BooleanOperation.ruleset".				
- ProximityDetection_WallJoinControl: Could not find rule set file "ProximityDetection_WallJoinControl.ruleset".				
- AppearanceAssetEditing: `Microsoft.Csharp.targets` cannot be imported again. It was already imported... This is most likely a build authoring error. This subsequent import will be ignored.
- SampleCommandsSteelElements: ditto

Cannot test, because use RvtSamplkes to load them...
