  stever66 recommended an intersting book on C#

  questions such as 'what is a computer?' and 'what is a programmer?'
  includes a huge amount of very good advice

Links to learning materials, including 2020.1 added features, to get an idea about shat is going on in this area
No officially supported API for Insight 360.
[Q] Our MEP design team is really interested in the Insight.
Can you provide a demonstration about it?
[A] Which Insight?
The one in BIM 360? 
http://help.autodesk.com/view/BIM360D/ENU/?guid=GUID-EC46253E-130E-4CE9-B0C1-2FB8333E1116
or Insight 360? 
https://insight.autodesk.com/oneenergy
Are you asking about a product feature demo?
Currently, there is no API for either.
But, depending on what you are trying to do, certain things might be possible, e.g., by writing a Revit add-in.
[R] I meant Insight 360, an add-in Revit.
Yes, I was asking about the product feature demo.
Later, we would also like to know about the API and customization.
As the basic preference, we would like to know the capability of Insight 360 on Revit like the lighting calculation/simulation, and Mechanical Load calculation/Analysis.
Our engineers are mainly using Revit, so we have basic knowledge of that.
Regarding the API, is it possible to customize it according to our preferences?
[A] I would suggest the following webinar recordings:
- For Insight (Energy and Lighting, but more about the Energy side)

- For Insight Lighting – This is a little old but a good introduction esp under the hood

<h3>C&#35; Book, Chinese Revit API Tutorial and Insight</h3>
<p>I very much enjoyed my quick visit
to <a href="https://www.swissbau.ch">Swissbau Basel</a> yesterday and meeting so many wonderful people there.
Kean shares details and photos of the event in his post
on <a href="https://www.keanw.com/2020/01/swissbau-2020.html">Swissbau 2020</a>.
Thanks to Kean for animating me to go!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, exciting topics keep piling in from
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> and
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Here are some recent getting started tips on various areas: programming in general, C#, the Revit API and Insight:</p>

<h4><a name="2"></a>The C&#35; Yellow Book</h4>
<p>Steve R recommends a very comprehensive tutorial book on C# in his answer
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/what-programming-language/m-p/9244502">what programming language</a>:</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book">C# Programming Yellow Book</a>
(<a href="/j/doc/book/cs_programming_yellow_book/csharp_book_2019_refresh.pdf">^</a>)
by <a href="https://www.robmiles.com">Rob Miles</a>.</p>
<p>It addresses just about everything you will ever need to know about C#, including questions such as 'what is a computer?' and 'what is a programmer?', a huge amount of other very good general programming advice, and is well worth browsing even for experienced programmers.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Steve for this nice pointer!</p>
