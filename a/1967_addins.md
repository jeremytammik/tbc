- Coding Revit add-ins: the e-verse way
  https://blog.e-verse.com/build/coding-revit-add-ins-the-e-verse-way
  > Hi Jeremy! Nice to "meet" you. I'm an architect/coder and have worked on many Revit addins these past few years, alongside other stuff like recently building and scaling e-verse (https://e-verse.com/). I wanted to share an article we recently published on our blog to see if it could help the community, shedding some light on the structure we use for Revit addins: https://blog.e-verse.com/build/coding-revit-add-ins-the-e-verse-way. I know you've covered this subject and shared many templates over the years since I've been a reader of The Building Coder for a while now, so I figured maybe we could contribute to that if you find anything you think can add value there. There's more to come as well. Thank you!

### BIM360 Links and Programming Add-Ins

Today, we share Naveen Kumar T's first Revit API blog post, an important solution to fix a problem loading BIM 360 links, and several different aspects of programming Revit add-0ins in general

####<a name="2"></a> New Revit Material Appearance Asset

Naveen Kumar T shared a blog post in
the [DAS AEC DevBlog](https://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec) showing
how to [set `AppearanceAsset` properties of a newly created Revit material](https://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2022/10/setting-appearanceasset-properties-of-newly-created-revit-material.html).

Many thanks to Naveen, and looking forward to many future posts.

####<a name="3"></a> BIM 360 Links Not Found Solution 

Luiz Henrique [@ricaun](https://github.com/ricaun) Cassettari shared a very helpful 
[BIM 360 links not found fix](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bim-360-links-not-found-fix/td-p/11463147):

A user reports to me that some of my plugins had problems with BIM360 links; after testing a lot of things, I found out what is causing the problem. It's a known problem here in the forum. It is caused by referencing a higher version of the `Newtonsoft.Json` package.

In Revit 2021, the default version of `Newtonsoft.Json` is 11; when an application or plugin requests to load `Newtonsoft.Json` version 13 and it is not found in the plugins folder, something strange happens.

Instead of ignoring and using the already loaded `Newtonsoft.Json` version 11, for some reason, Revit loads a `Newtonsoft.Json` file from the Autodesk `PnIDModeler` add-in, and it is a version 11.

Now, if you have two copies of `Newtonsoft.Json` with the same version loaded in Revit, when BIM360 tries to initialize (usually happens when you open a Revit file that requires BIM360), it will throw an exception in the Journal and the BIM360 service fails. Without the service, Revit can't load BIM360 link. It displays this message:

<center>
<img src="img/ricaun_bim360_link_cannot_load.png" alt="Cannot load BIM360 link" title="Cannot load BIM360 link" width="400"/> <!-- 802 x 603 -->
</center>

A quick fix would be to remove or change the name of the 'Newtonsoft.Json.dll' file in the Autodesk `PnIDModeler` add-in.

Or, if you are a developer using an old version like version 9, it should work; Revit will load the default version instead. But if you need to use a specific version of `Newtonsoft.Json`, be aware that it could cause some issues in Revit.

####<a name="4"></a> AppStore Guidelines for Revit Add-In

If you are thinking about programming a Revit add-in in general, and especially if your are thinking about the AppStore, you should check out the AppStore guidelines and its numerous useful general development recommendations:

####<a name="5"></a> Coding Revit Add-Ins the E-Verse Way

Going much further and on into the modern development process, a comprehensive guide explaining more complex and intricate aspects of Revit add-in coding is presented by
Francisco Maranchello of [e-verse](https://e-verse.com) in his article
on [coding Revit add-ins the e-verse way](https://blog.e-verse.com/build/coding-revit-add-ins-the-e-verse-way), saying:

> I'm an architect and coder and have worked on many Revit addins these past few years, alongside other stuff like recently building and scaling [e-verse](https://e-verse.com/).
I wanted to share an article we recently published on our blog to see if it could help the community, shedding some light on the structure we use for Revit addins:

There's more to come as well.
Thank you!

Francisco covers the complete add-in ecosystem including:

- Git code repository
- A .NET framework solution containing multiple projects
- NuGet dependencies
- Post-build events for debugging and releasing 
- A configuration file to manage settings and environment variables outside the main logic
- CI/CD pipelines leveraging GitHub Actions

Very many thanks to Francisco for sharing his experience and in-depth advice!

####<a name="5"></a> VS Wizard Template Location

One of the templates mentioned above is the very simple and minimal
[Visual Studio Revit Add-in Template](https://github.com/jeremytammik/VisualStudioRevitAddinWizard) for
C# and VB.

I recently resolved an issue I had getting it to work on my system using Parallels on the Mac.
My template was dispalyed, and I had a hard time discovering why.
For instance, the thread
on how to [fix Visual Studio when templates disappear from your Add New Item dialogue](https://kwilson.io/blog/fix-visual-studio-when-templates-disappear-from-your-add-new-item-dialogue) did
not help.

Finally, I discoverd that some part of the Parallels setup had modified my VS project template location settings:

</center>

<center>
<img src="img/vs_2019_project_template_location.png" alt="Visual Studio project template location" title="Visual Studio project template location" width="400"/> <!-- 1276 x 870 -->
</center>

Once that was understood, the issue was easy to resolve, setting the location back to the default folder on the C: drive.

I also added a corresponding note to the [readme](https://github.com/jeremytammik/VisualStudioRevitAddinWizard#user-project-template-location) for
my own and others' future reference.
