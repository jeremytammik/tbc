- parameter type change breaks families
[Q]
We have some families that fail to load (only in 2021).  We think we have narrowed it down to a Revit change.

Would you or someone be able to review this and let us know if it is a bug or feature?  Is there a published list of changes for other parameters that can review.

When you export to a type “Family Types” in Revit 2012-2020 for PIPING__FLOW (GPM) you get for instance:
Cold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE

When you do the same in Revit 2021, however you get:
Cold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE

The bad news being that Revit 2021 does not accept GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE Anymore, instead it expects (and does not ‘upconvert’) the new US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE.
Eg for 2000+ existing type catalogs this is a breaking change!!

[A] I found this Jira:
https://jira.autodesk.com/browse/REVIT-158981

GLOB: Units INCHES_OF_WATER and GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE no longer work in Revit 2021 txt family type catalogs

According to Jira, the change is intentional.  But probably upgrade from the previous verion is not working?

The change to the DB string is intentional. No upgrade from the previous version’s DB strings has been implemented.

We documented the changes in the [developer guide](https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2021/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_html).

<h3>Revit 2021 Unit Types in Family Type Catalogues</h3>

<h4><a name="2"></a> Unit Type Update Affects Family Type Catalogue Loading</h4>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> We have some families that fail to load in Revit 2021.</p>
<p>We have narrowed it down to a Revit change.</p>
<p>When you export PIPING__FLOW (GPM) data to a type 'Family Types' in previous versions of Revit, you get something like this:</p>
<pre>
Cold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE
</pre>

<p>However, when you do the same in Revit 2021, you get:</p>
<pre>
Cold Water Flow##PIPING_FLOW##US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE
</pre>

<p>The bad news for us being that Revit 2021 does not accept GALLONS_US_PER_MINUTE anymore.
Instead, it expects (and does not ‘upconvert’) the new US_GALLONS_PER_MINUTE.</p>
<p>This is a breaking change for our existing type catalogues.</p>
<p>Is there a published list of changes for parameters that we can review?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, indeed, this is an intentional change.
Sorry that it is affecting you so hard.
Just as you say, no automatic upgrade from the previous version’s DB strings has been implemented.</p>
<p>We documented these changes in the <a href="https://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2021/ENU/?guid=Revit_API_Revit_API_Developers_Guide_html">developer guide</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a> New FreeCodeCamp Courses</h4>
<p>I always enjoy browsing through the FreeCodeCamp courses recommended in Quincy Larson's newsletter.</p>
<p>Last week's bunch looked especially useful to me, for instance these:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Padlocking The Building Coder</h4>
<p>Last week, colleagues pointed out that some of the Autodesk developer blogs were displaying a message saying 'Not secure' in the browser address bar:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/why_no_padlock_blog_url_not_secure.png" alt="Address bar warning 'not secure'" title="Address bar warning 'not secure'" width="504"/>
</center></p>
<p>The problem is caused by a mixed content error, where some references from the blog are not secure.</p>
<p>You can check the site either in Firefox, or using an external page, e.g., <a href="https://www.whynopadlock.com">whynopadlock.com</a>, which will conveniently show the references causing the mixed content error:</p>

<p>In The Building Coder, it was only the banner image, and it can be simply fixed by adding <code>https</code> to the image reference in the CSS.</p>
