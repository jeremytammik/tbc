I believe I just answered a very similar question in the Revit API discussion forum thread on [how to get a merged part after merging with some parts](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-get-a-merged-part-after-merging-with-some-parts/td-p/7772648):
You can subscribe to [the DocumentChanged event](http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/988dd6cf-fcaa-85d2-622d-c50f13917a13.htm) just before calling CreateParts, and unsubscribe just afterwards.
That will tell you all the element ids added to the database during the call.
This is demonstrated in the discussion on [retrieving newly placed family instances](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/place-family-instance.html).

<h3>Retrieving Newly Created Element Ids</h3>
<p>An add-in will often need to retrieve the elements that it just created for further processing.</p>
<p>Frequently, the Revit API method used to create them will return their element ids.</p>
<p>Sometimes, that is not the case.</p>
<p>We already discussed a simple and effective method to retrieve all newly created elements following a call to
the <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/b05a17df-3f63-9172-8e49-d2e1e6b8e9e2.htm"><code>PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement</code> method</a> by
subscribing to the <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/988dd6cf-fcaa-85d2-622d-c50f13917a13.htm"><code>DocumentChanged</code> event</a> just
beforehand in the discussion
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/06/place-family-instance.html">placing family instances</a>.</p>
<p>Now this topic arose again in a couple of cases and brought some other aspects to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Using the element lister</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Consecutive element ids</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Retrieving recently added elements</a></li>
<li><a href="#5">AEC job openings in Munich and elsewhere</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Using the Element Lister</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/debugging-and-maintaining-the-image-relationship.html#2">element lister</a> provides
an easy way to discover element relationships between related objects that are added to Revit by certain operations.</p>
<p>It is included
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">AdnRevitApiLabsXtra, the ADN Revit API Training Labs including Xtra</a>.</p>
<p>All it does is grab all elements in the entire database and list whatever properties you are interested in, e.g., element id, category, level, .NET class, etc.</p>
<p>Then you can use
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff_utility">Unix <code>diff</code> tool</a> to
compare states before and after doing your thing.</p>
<p>It can be well combined with
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/BipChecker">built-in parameter checker BipChecker</a> to explore the properties in further depth.</p>
<p>Of course,
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/11/intimate-revit-database-exploration-with-the-python-shell.html">most intimate database exploration</a> requires
a live read-evaluate-print console.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Consecutive Element Ids</h4>
<p>Using any of the techniques listed above, you will quickly determine that Revit element ids are basically consecutive numbers.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee for this, of course, and they can be mixed up by work-sharing operations.</p>
<p>They can only be used to identify an element within one single Revit document.</p>
<p>Because they are assigned consecutively, Revit automatically generates
many <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/undocumented-elementid-relationships.html">undocumented <code>ElementId</code> relationships</a>.</p>
<p>For more persistent identification, a <code>UniqueId</code> is recommended.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, Revit elements have two identifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/44f3f7b1-3229-3404-93c9-dc5e70337dd6.htm">Element id <code>ElementId</code></a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/f9a9cb77-6913-6d41-ecf5-4398a24e8ff8.htm">Unique id <code>UniqueId</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>We discuss their uses in lots of places, e.g.,
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/02/understanding-the-use-of-the-uniqueid.html">understanding the use of the <code>UniqueId</code></a>.</p>
<p>For connecting with an external database, I would suggest using the UniqueId.</p>
<p>One simple sample that shows the whole connection strategy is provided by
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud">FireRatingCloud add-in</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Retrieving Recently Added Elements</h4>
<p>So let us summarise the above again to answer
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-get-a-merged-part-after-merging-with-some-parts/td-p/7772648">how to get a merged part after merging with some parts</a> and

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong> I have merged some parts using <code>PartUtils.CreateMergedPart</code>.</p>
<p>The output is not a <code>Part</code>, but a <code>PartMaker</code>.</p>
<p>I need a part output.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get a merged part object?</p>
<p><strong>Question 2:</strong> I am using <code>PartUtils.CreateParts</code> to create parts and would like to collect the results as a list of element ids.</p>
<p>How can I achieve that, please?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> As said above, you can subscribe to
