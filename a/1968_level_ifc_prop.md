  For adding custom props to IFC, there is no direct way with Revit. We need to the below to achieve that:
  Open the IFC model with Revit’s OpenIFC (API: Application.OpenIFCDocument) to convert IFC to RVT
  Add customer props by share parameters and give values (sample code from Jeremy)
  Define custom Property Sets for IFC (here is a tutorial video from 3rd-party or check this AKN page)
  Specify the custom Property Sets in IFC export setup (See userDefinedPSets in Revit IFC repo to know how to construct IFCExportOptions for API)
  Export the modified RVT to IFC (API: Document.Export)

  For those who are still stuck with this problem even when using the correct overload:
    public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance(
      XYZ location,
      FamilySymbol symbol,
      Element host,
      StructuralType structuralType
    )
  It is essential to pass in the function parameter host as a Level and not as an Element.
  Add a quick cast like (Level)MyHostElement and it should do the trick and the Level parameter is created properly and is not read-only.
  Keep in mind, this will screw up the offset values, but you can adjust those afterwards.

  [A] On some elements, the element level can only be set during the creation of the element. For that, I would assume that you need to use a different [overload of the `NewFamilyInstance` method](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/0c0d640b-7810-55e4-3c5e-cd295dede87b.htm).

###Element Level and IFC Properties

####<a name="3"></a> Forge and IFC

Wondering about your options when translating IFC model formats using the Autodesk Platform Services (APS), previously known as Forge?
Developer advocate Eason [@yiskang](https://twitter.com/yiskang) Kang put together
a comprehensive list of [FAQ and Tips for IFC translation of Model Derivative API](https://forge.autodesk.com/blog/faq-and-tips-ifc-translation-model-derivative-api) that
might help, including and not limited to:

- Overview of different available IFC conversion methods
- Georeferencing in IFC

####<a name="3"></a> IFC Custom Properties

Eason recently addressed another important IFC related question:

**Question:** Can the Revit API be used to add custom properties in an IFC file opened in Revit?
Can Revit export this IFC with those new properties?
Do you know if DGN supports changing or adding properties?
Is it viable using Revit API?

**Answer:** There is no direct way in Revit to add custom properties to IFC.
However, it can be achieved through the following:

- Open the IFC model with Revit’s OpenIFC
(API: [Application.OpenIFCDocument](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/bb14933b-a758-2b34-b160-686a28cc48cb.htm)) to
convert IFC to RVT
- Add customer properties by adding shared parameters and specifying values for them
([sample code](https://github.com/jeremytammik/FireRatingCloud/blob/master/FireRatingCloud/Cmd_1_CreateAndBindSharedParameter.cs) from
The Building Coder)
- Define custom Property Sets for IFC (here is a [tutorial video from 3rd-party](https://youtu.be/SswHKtcM3mI) or
check this [AKN page](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/simplecontent/content/export-custom-bim-standards-and-property-sets-to-ifc.html))
- Specify the custom Property Sets in IFC export setup
(See [userDefinedPSets in Revit IFC repo](https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/blob/df1485b9accd598c2912a055af205ee1b03648c7/Source/IFCExporterUIOverride/IFCExportConfiguration.cs#L425) to
know how to construct IFCExportOptions for API)
- Export the modified RVT to IFC
(API: [Document.Export](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/7efa4eb3-8d94-b8e7-f608-3dbae751331d.htm))

Returning to pure desktop Revit API topics, several discussions recently in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) circled
around setting the level of an existing element, e.g.:

**Question:** I'm placing a new face-based family instance into my Revit model with the help of the NewFamilyInstance method taking (Face, XYZ, XYZ, FamilySymbol).
This works fine, except the instance does not have its level set to that of the host; it's set to -1 in the API and just left blank in the UI.
I tried setting the level like such usng the placed instance `LevelId` property and also tried setting its `BuiltInParameter` `FAMILY_LEVEL_PARAM`.
Both throw an error saying the parameter is read-only.

**Answer:** On some elements, the element level can only be set during the creation of the element.
For that, I would assume that you need to use a different [overload of the `NewFamilyInstance` method](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/0c0d640b-7810-55e4-3c5e-cd295dede87b.htm).
Please refer to this explanation by The Building Coder and a few recent discussions of related topics in the Revit API discussion forum:

Another potentially helpful suggestion came up on the blog:

####<a name="5"></a> Set Level in NewFamilyInstance

Xikes shared a valusable observation in
their [comment](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/family-instance-missing-level-property.html#comment-5925189938)
on [family instance missing `Level` property](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/01/family-instance-missing-level-property.html):

For those who are still stuck with this problem even when using the correct overload:

<pre class="code">
  public FamilyInstance NewFamilyInstance(
    XYZ location,
    FamilySymbol symbol,
    Element host, 
    StructuralType structuralType )
</pre>

It is essential to pass in the function parameter `host` as a `Level` and not as an `Element`.
Add a quick cast like `(Level) myHostElement`.
It should do the trick.
The `Level` parameter is created properly and is not read-only.
Keep in mind that this will screw up the offset values, but you can adjust those afterwards.

It would be very helpful if other developers could confirm this observation.
Thank you.
