<h4><a name="2"></a>Forge Accelerators in India and France</h4>
<p>New Forge Accelerator events have been announced in to take place in Bangalore, India, September 4-8, and Lyon, France, October 23-27.</p>
<p>Participants spend the week at the workshop intensively working on their Forge-based projects with one-on-one help and advice from our DevTech and engineering teams. As with previous accelerators, participants benefit from several key opportunities during these workshops, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>In-depth focus on important aspects of cloud development</li>
<li>Learning,  including daily discussions led by industry and web service API experts</li>
<li>One-on-one help from Autodesk DevTech experts in real-time throughout the event</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you have an idea for a new cloud-based app using Autodesk Forge APIs, or you need help getting an existing app up and running well, come along to the accelerator event that suits you.  There is no cost to attend &ndash; you are only responsible for your own travel costs including airfare, hotel, and food &ndash; although Autodesk generally picks up the cost for some meals during the week. </p>

<p>The closing date for submitting your proposal is July 31 for Bangalore and September 8 for Lyon.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>BIM 360 Online Hackathon</h4>
<p>The Autodesk App Store team will be conducting its fifth annual online hackathon from August 1 to October 31, 2017.</p>
<p>This year, the hackathon is dedicated to apps that use the <a href="https://developer.autodesk.com/en/docs/bim360/v1/overview">BIM 360 API</a>.</p>
<p>The hackathon will consist of a series of web training sessions as detailed below.  During the sessions, you will have the opportunity to receive help in real-time from the Autodesk Forge team. For all new apps on the BIM 360 platform submitted to the Autodesk App Store and accepted for publication in the store, a reward of 500 USD will be given, for one eligible app per entrant.</p>
<ul>
<li>August 15 &ndash; BIM 360 business opportunities with AppStore</li>
<li>August 16 &ndash; Introduction to BIM360 and Forge API</li>
<li>August 17 &ndash; Authentication and Data Management</li>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Call for Revit Add-In Developers using Dockable Pane and Point Cloud Engine</h4>
<p>Do you use Dockable Panes or the Revit Point Cloud Engine API in your Revit application?</p>
<p>If so, please read on.</p>
<p>The Revit product team is planning to make enhancements in both these areas and would like to work with partners who use these features in their applications. The goal is to understand the partner application usage of these APIs and make sure to enable a smooth transition to the new APIs.   </p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Point Cloud Engine API</b> &ndash; The functionality of this API is to provide access to different kinds of point clouds to Revit. Autodesk ReCap Pro provides similar functionality with enhanced capabilities. We would like to hear your feedback about how this API is currently being used and any of your concerns of the API change.</li>
<li><b>Dockable Pane</b> &ndash; This is a user interface API that allows a third-party application to add a custom pane to the Revit docking window system. It may be combined with additional UI features such as drag and drop, selection and events. We are working on a modernized version of this feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are interested in discussing and testing the new APIs, working closely with the Revit product team, please send an e-mail to:</p>
