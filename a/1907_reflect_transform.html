<h4><a name="2"></a> Flip, Mirror and Transform</h4>
<p>A careful analysis by Richard in the thread 
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/gettransform-does-not-include-reflection-into-the-transformation/m-p/10334547"><code>GetTransform</code> does not include reflection into the transformation</a> clarifies
the effects of rotation and reflection achieved by mirroring and flipping on the BIM element transform:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> The 
<a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2015/50aa275d-031e-ce19-9cfd-18a7a341ed19.htm"><code>Instance.GetTransform</code> method</a>
does not include reflection, e.g.,
the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2015/20ab2f32-e3ca-8173-aac3-a03e998fd0ab.htm">family mirrored property</a> into
its transformation.
Below a family instance which is mirrored and outputs the equivalent <code>GetTansform</code> values:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/GetTransform_ignores_mirror_1.png" alt="GetTransform ignores reflection" title="GetTransform ignores reflection" width="800"/> <!-- 1401 -->
</center></p>
<p>Here is the python code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
import sys
import clr
clr.AddReference('ProtoGeometry')
from Autodesk.DesignScript.Geometry import *
data= UnwrapElement(IN[0])

output=[]
for i in data:
    output.append(i.Location.Point)
    output.append(i.GetTransform().BasisX)
    output.append(i.GetTransform().BasisY)
    output.append(i.GetTransform().BasisZ)
    output.append("")
OUT = output
</pre>

<p>That is expected and intentional in Revit.</p>
<p>However, from a mathematical perspective, it should not be expected.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_matrix">Wikipedia article on Transformation matrix</a> shows
clearly that an element that is reflected around the <code>X</code> axis should have a different transformation matrix:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/GetTransform_ignores_mirror_2.png" alt="Transformation with reflection" title="Transformation with reflection" width="216"/> <!-- 216 -->
</center></p>
<p>Can you please share any explanation and why this intentional for Revit? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I found results that indicate Revit uses a combination of reflection and rotation for the various mirror and flip operations:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/GetTransform_ignores_mirror_3.png" alt="Flip and mirror" title="Flip and mirror" width="800"/> <!-- 1144 -->
</center></p>
<p>One thing that stands out is the difference between horizontal double flip control and mirror command about same axis (noted red).
These operations are almost identical apart from the horizontal one that results in opposite facing and handed state.
Graphically, it appears the same, but not according to facing/handed orientation.</p>
<p>It has been noted previously that single flip control is more like rotating rather than mirroring (it doesn't result in reflected geometry).
We see by transform that it is reflected but facing/handed state is also set to true.</p>
<p>Generally, I think of the facing/handed state as being an internal to the family state, i.e., the internal geometry may be reflected but the family itself isn't (unless it is by transform).</p>
<p>You probably need to look at flip state/rotation and transform to get a definitive idea of the situation.
These controls long ago I believe were introduced for doors, which side they are hung and swing direction.
As they started being used for other things, the ambiguities crept in, i.e., double negative (same ultimate representation but two definitions for it).</p>
<h5><a name="2.1"></a> Motivation and Chilling Example</h5>
<p>I think everyone has probably fallen foul of these geometric aspects at some point.
I recall we had a pile cap with four piles and we marked one of the corners so that we could identify the edges numerically in a clockwise order around this square cap (which had double symmetry).
The idea was that we would have a table of parameters which noted the edge distances (edge of cap to edge of pile).
What we didn't count on was the fact sometimes people mirrored these caps, so although the corner marker flipped from one side to the other as expected the numbering of edges was no longer clockwise.
So, numbered edge distances in table didn't correspond with what was counted clockwise from corner marker.</p>
<p>The question is why would someone mirror a symmetrical object?
The answer was that this cap was one of many and there was a line of symmetry across the site.
Therefore, they had filled half the site with pile caps and mirrored them for completion (perfectly acceptable).
An important lesson from this is that the flip state of the symmetrical object was a hidden feature with subtle implications (when identifying parametric relationships).</p>
<p>Many thanks to Richard for this very helpful explanation!</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Transient Elements Hack</h4>
<p>Back in 2018, the development team clearly stated that the
interesting-looking <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2021.1/0decdddc-ae4a-d46d-d141-9d37e7973e05.htm"><code>Document.MakeTransientElements</code> method</a>
is 'half-finished' work that should not have been exposed to the public API and will probably be removed again.</p>
<p>It has not been removed yet, though, so Moustafa Khalil and Richard discussed a hacky approach to make it do something at all in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/document-maketransientelements/m-p/7774471"><code>Document.MakeTransientElements</code></a>,
in case you are interested in taking a further look yourself.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of completeness, some other officially supported approaches to display non-BIM-geometry
include <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/avf">AVF</a>,
DirectContext3D and, new in Revit 2022, 
the <a href="#4">temporary incanvas graphics API</a> (below).</p>
