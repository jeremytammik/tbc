What is Revit?
What is the Revit API?
How can I access the Revit API?
How can I drive Revit automatically though a command line script?
How can I create wall programmatically?
Is there a sample that creates an entire sample building?
Is there a way to set a timeout on a Revit API Transaction? Use Case: During some of our longer processes (usually in APS), there are sometimes transactions that take a very long time to commit (we've seen in the worse case a transaction take 1-2 hours, this is usually around element copying when there are thousands of elements). We'd like a way to for example say if the transaction takes longer than 10 minutes, to kill and rollback the transaction.
Is it possible to save a Revit project in JSON format and later load it again? I want my plugin to save all elements in the BIM to JSON, including parameter data and geometry info, and later load that JSON into a new project.
I have a lot of mass elements and want to create walls from their faces. I can do so by manually selecting each face and creating a wall on it in the UI. Is there any way I can automate this? Also, when the mass element changes, I want the wall to be updated also.
How can I add new parameters to all rooms in a project?
I'm coding up some structural rebar in C# and could use some advice on how to get solid geometry of rebar.
How to rotate face based family instances? My code automatically adds hangers to ducts. The code works fine when the duct is horizontal; in these cases, all the hangers are placed properly. However, when the ducts are sloped, the hangers also become aligned. I need help ensuring that the hangers are placed vertically even when the ducts are not perfectly horizontal.
