- back to the basics:
  And whoever else is interested in the Revit API:
  I just answered four cases this morning on StackOverflow and in the discussion forum where I repeat some basic recommendations that I have already given hundreds of times in the past:

  I would really be happy if I did not have to continue repeating them over and over again.
  All four of these could give a blog post each, or all four together.
  At the very least, I hope that you guys all agree with me that the recommendations I make there are sensible and relevant.
  Please read them, tell me what you think, and feel free to summarise them in one or several blog posts of your own, if you like.
  Above all, please confirm that you understand them and let me know if you have any questions or doubts whatsoever.

<h3>Back to Basics and ChatGPT</h3>
<p>I answered a couple of basic questions for the umpteenth time and thought I might summarise some of them here yet again.</p>
<p>I am still impressed and intrigued by what ChatGPT can and cannot do, and keep trying out new aspects myself and with my friends.</p>
<p>I strongly advise anyone interested in it to try it out for yourself rather than just reading the numerous articles published by others.</p>
<h4><a name="2"></a> Back to the Basics</h4>
<p>Here are a couple of typical questions from StackOverflow and the discussion forum where I repeat some basic recommendations that I have already given before:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#3">Element filtering</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">XYZ trigonometry</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Projecting points</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe, by now, or very soon, based on the publicly available information, ChatGPT and other pretrained language models will be able to answer them just as well or better than I can.</p>

I am sure that by now, based on the publicly available information, ChatGPT can answer them just as well or better than I have done.

I hope that you guys all agree with me that the recommendations I make there are sensible and relevant.

Please let me know if you disagree or can improve on them in any way.

<h4><a name="3"></a> Element Filtering</h4>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74806242/simplify-a-series-of-repetitive-functions-with-sort-options">Simplify a series of repetitive functions with sort options</a></p>
<p>I have a series of functions in a module which are starting to become quite repetitive. Each function extracts a list, and has an optional Boolean argument to sort the list before returning it. Feels like there ought to be a way to inherit the sorting from a parent function?</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
def get_electrical_equipment(sort_by_name = False):

  elements =  DB.FilteredElementCollector(revit.doc)\
    .OfCategory(DB.BuiltInCategory.OST_ElectricalEquipment)\
    .WhereElementIsNotElementType()\
    .ToElements()

  if sort_by_name: elements.sort(key=lambda x: x.Name)

  return elements

def get_panel_schedules(sort_by_name = False):
  elements = DB.FilteredElementCollector(revit.doc)\
    .WherePasses(DB.ElementClassFilter(DB.Electrical.PanelScheduleView))\
    .WhereElementIsNotElementType()\
    .ToElements()

  if sort_by_name: elements.sort(key=lambda x: x.Name)

  return elements

def get_panel_schedule_sheet_instances(sort_by_name = False):
  elements = DB.FilteredElementCollector(revit.doc)\
    .OfClass(DB.Electrical.PanelScheduleSheetInstance)\
    .ToElements()

  if sort_by_name: elements.sort(key=lambda x: x.Name)

  return elements
</pre>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> First, I think you can completely eliminate the call to <code>ToElements</code>. 
It is a waste of memory and computation time, as I have pointed out repeatedly in the past, e.g., 
in <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/how-to-distinguish-redundant-rooms.html#2">How to Distinguish Redundant Rooms</a>. </p>
<p>Now, to address your question, you can simply implement a common method <code>get_elements_of_category_and_class</code> taking a category and a class argument. 
Pass in either one or the other or both and execute <code>OfClass</code> and <code>OfCategory</code> checks on the filtered element collector, either one or the other or both, skipping evaluation of <code>null</code>-valued arguments.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> XYZ Trigonometry</h4>
<p>Another recurring question is basic trigonometry, such 
as <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-create-a-vector-xyz-tilted-up-from-the-view-direction-by/m-p/11621339">how to create a vector <code>XYZ</code> tilted up from the view direction by a specified angle</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a the view direction that I use for my reference intersector. 
I would like to try various altitude angles up from the view direction in a section with starting point at a wall like in this section view:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/vector_tilted_up.png" alt="Vector tilted up from plane" title="Vector tilted up from plane" width="600"/> <!-- 1199 × 530 pixels -->
</center></p>
<p>I know there are transforms and various complex maths answers on StackOverflow; I was hoping to use a simpler built-in method if available? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> This kind of trigonometry is not difficult. 
Your children learn it in school, I hope. 
Please take a moment to either read 
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Law_of_tangents">Wikipedia article on Trigonometric functions and the Law of tangents</a> or 
study some other tutorials. 
From that article, I find this image on the unit circle definitions of six trigonometric functions most helpful:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/trigonometry_functions.png" alt="Unit circle definitions of six trigonometric functions" title="Unit circle definitions of six trigonometric functions" width="320"/> <!-- 640 × 836 pixels -->
</center></p>
<p>Decide what angle you wish to use, e.g., 30 degrees. 
Determine its tangens value, ca. 30 x 3.14 / 180 = 0.5. 
Take your horizontal view direction XYZ vector (x,y,0). 
Replace the Z coordinate by the tangens you calculated, yielding  (x,y,0.5). 
Voila. 
That is your new tilted direction vector. 
You may normalise it if you like.</p>
<p>Please do not be afraid of trigonometry, it is very intuitive as soon as you stop being scared of it.</p>
<p>I condemn our teachers and education systems (not all, but all too many) for inoculating kids with fear of maths and geometry.</p>
<p>This is basic human intuitive understanding. 
The greeks mastered it 3000 years ago. 
We can handle a computer and a smartphone, but not simple trigonometry? </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><strong>Answer 2:</strong> I would probably look at it in terms of the ratio between the forward direction and XYZ.BasisZ that the angle represents.</p>
<p>Also, the <code>XYZ</code> class has good functionality for arithmetic operations.</p>
<p>Similar as noted above, below shows an easy way:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Dim V0 As New XYZ(1, 0.5, 0) 'some random flat direction
V0 = V0.Normalize
Dim Ang As Double = 30 'Angle in degrees
Dim Ang_r As Double = (Math.PI / 180) * Ang
Dim T As Double = Math.Tan(Ang_r) 'Tan(Ang) = Opp/1
Dim Vz As New XYZ(0, 0, T)
Dim V1 As XYZ = (V0 + Vz).Normalize 'The direction with tilt of 30 degrees up from horizontal
</pre>

<p>This works from 0 to &lt; 90.<br />
From that point on, you have to check the quadrant and consider the <code>Tan</code> function doesn't work approaching 90 or 270 degrees, but you know those values are looking straight up and straight down respectively.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a> Projecting Points</h4>
<p><a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/using-avf-on-ductwork-coordinates-issue/m-p/11621128">Using AVF on ductwork - Coordinates issue?</a></p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am currently trying to create an add-in that will allow me to perform a calculation on various points on a duct face.</p>
<p>For now, the user is selecting the face, but in the future, I plan to process the top face of each duct in the view.</p>
<p>I am following along with the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RvtFader">RvtFader example project</a>.</p>
<p>A reference to my face is passed into the <code>SpatialFieldManager</code>, exactly like in the RvtFader example. </p>
<p>The UpdateSpatialFieldPrimiate method runs without error, and my duct is shaded with a single solid color.</p>
<p>I believe my issue is that I am feeding the FieldDomainPointsByUV with UV points that are in the global coordinate system instead of the local coordinates system to the face. I suspect because create a BoundingBoxUV of my face, and supplying the bb.Min and bb.Max, along with 0, 10 as FieldValues, I get a correctly shaded (using a gradient) duct. </p>
<p>Is there a way to convert WCS XYZ points to local UV points?</p>
<p>I assume I don't care about the Z coordinate...</p>
<p>What am I missing here? </p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Normally, the <code>UV</code> coordinates depend on the face. 
Simply converting the <code>XYZ</code> X and Y values directly to UV will not work.</p>
<p>To convert a XYZ point to the face UV space, you can use 
the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/4bee3e30-74fa-3103-c2f4-d07618fbcedf.htm">Face.Project method</a> to 
project it from global 3D space onto the face 2D.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you. That was just what I needed!</p>
<h4><a name="9"></a> Train ChatGPT for Revit API</h4>
<p>I asked ChatGPT some basic questions to determine whether it knows about the Revit API, Dynamo, The Building Coder blog and the Revit API discussion forum. 
The results were surprisingly mixed:</p>
<p>jeremy: Do you know about the Revit API?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: Yes, I am familiar with the Revit API. The Revit API is a software application programming interface (API) that allows users to access and manipulate the data contained in Autodesk Revit projects. This API can be used to develop custom tools and applications that integrate with Revit, allowing users to automate tasks and extend the functionality of the software.</p>
<p>jeremy: So, what is the difference between Revit API and Dynamo?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: Dynamo is a visual programming platform that can be used with Revit to automate and simplify tasks and workflows. The Revit API, on the other hand, is a set of programming tools and libraries that can be used to develop custom applications and tools that integrate with Revit. While Dynamo is a user-friendly platform that allows users to create scripts and automate tasks without writing code, the Revit API is a more advanced tool that requires some programming knowledge to use effectively. Additionally, Dynamo is built on top of the Revit API, so using the Revit API allows for even greater customization and control over the automation of tasks in Revit.</p>
<p>jeremy: Do you know the Revit API discussion forum?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: I am not aware of a specific discussion forum for the Revit API. However, there are many online forums and communities where users of the Revit API can ask questions, share tips and advice, and discuss their experiences with the API. Some examples of these forums include the Autodesk Developer Network forums, the Autodesk Revit API discussion group on LinkedIn, and the Revit API discussion forum on Autodesk Community. These forums can be a great resource for users of the Revit API who are looking for help, advice, or simply want to connect with other users of the API.</p>
<p>jeremy: Do you know The Building Coder blog?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but I am not aware of The Building Coder blog. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my knowledge is based on the text that has been fed into my training data. I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access additional information outside of what has been provided to me during my training. I apologize if I am unable to provide you with the information you are looking for. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?</p>
<p>jeremy: Can you read The Building Coder blog 
at <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/">thebuildingcoder.typepad.com</a> so 
that you later have access to that information?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As a language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access information outside of what has been provided to me during my training. I am only able to provide information and respond to questions based on the text that has been fed into my training data. I apologize if I am unable to provide you with the information you are looking for. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?</p>
<p>jeremy: Can I provide you with additional training text to expand your knowledge in a specific domain?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: As a pre-trained language model, I am not able to accept additional training text or expand my knowledge in a specific domain. My knowledge is based on the text that was used to train me, and I do not have the ability to learn or acquire new information outside of what was included in my training data. I am designed to assist with a wide range of questions and topics, but my answers are limited to the information and knowledge that was provided to me during my training. If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to try to provide an answer based on my existing knowledge.</p>
<p>jeremy: Can I access the your source code in order to expand your training myself?</p>
<p>ChatGPT: I'm sorry, but I am not a physical machine or computer program that can be accessed or modified. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I exist solely as a virtual assistant that is able to provide answers to questions and respond to statements based on the text that was used to train me. I do not have a source code or any other physical representation that can be accessed or modified. I apologize if I am unable to meet your request. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?</p>
<h4><a name="7"></a> Generative AI and Multi-Modal Learning</h4>
<p>The past few months hint at exciting and adventurous times full of radical change ahead.</p>
<p>The speed at which machine learning models are evolving is breathtaking. 
There are more companies, labs and institutions working on these than ever before. 
The language model GPT3 from OpenAI, released in 2021, was a key breakthrough.
This year, OpenAI plans to release GPT4, an even larger language model. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The disruption from this technology is like nothing we have ever encountered in software history. 
It is paralleled only by the advent of the computer itself. 
This technology will be more impactful than the Internet, mobile computing, and GUIs. 
It stands to upend every aspect of how we work. 
It will fundamentally change how we interact with computers, treating them as something closer to an assistant than a smart calculator. 
The very essence of what it means to create something will change. 
We will feel challenged by these systems in novel ways. 
This technology disrupts entire industries. 
Legal frameworks will be at a loss for how to adjust. 
New economies will appear while others die off. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>What powers this innovation? </p>
<p>Behind the amazing capabilities of these models are two concepts: Generative AI and Multi-Modal Learning. 
The most prevalent examples of Generative AI are Large Language Models (LLM) that both ingest and produce language.
Researchers feed LLMs with immense amounts of text across every spoken, written and computer language that exists. 
The models learn to correlate and produce new, original text based on prompts with astonishing results. </p>
<p>One way to think of these models is that they are learning language and how we use it by discovering the patterns and frequencies of words and how we group them. 
As LLMs scale up and train across vast amounts of text, including many spoken and computer languages, the models learn increasingly advanced and nuanced concepts that have meaning to us. 
It seems like magic.
That’s because language is so central to being human.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The truly unique feature of our language is... the ability to transmit information 
about things that do not exist at all. As far as we know, only Sapiens can talk 
about entire kinds of entities that they have never seen, touched or smelled.
<span style="text-align: right; font-style: italic">&ndash; Yuval Noah Harari, Sapiens</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Multi-modal learning is an old idea and, just as with language, it is something deeply human. 
It means to learn from multiple sources of information at the same time, inferring the relationships and meanings across them. 
Our brains are extremely good at this, especially when we are babies and toddlers. 
It is a key ingredient in how we learn about the world. 
Seeing a toy block, feeling its sharp corners, hearing the sound it makes when it falls on the floor, and then hearing a parent say “block” is all part of a multi-modal learning process. </p>

</ul>
<p>the <a href="http://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto">Solarpunk Manifesto</a>:</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a> Solarpunk</h4>
<p>Solarpunk is a movement in speculative fiction, art, fashion, and activism that seeks to answer and embody the question “what does a sustainable civilization look like, and how can we get there?” </p>
<p>The aesthetics of solarpunk merge the practical with the beautiful, the well-designed with the green and lush, the bright and colorful with the earthy and solid. </p>
<p>Solarpunk can be utopian, just optimistic, or concerned with the struggles en route to a better world ,  but never dystopian. As our world roils with calamity, we need solutions, not only warnings.</p>
<p>Solutions to thrive without fossil fuels, to equitably manage real scarcity and share in abundance instead of supporting false scarcity and false abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.</p>
<p>Solarpunk is at once a vision of the future, a thoughtful provocation, a way of living and a set of achievable proposals to get there.</p>
<p>We are solarpunks because optimism has been taken away from us and we are trying to take it back.</p>
<p>We are solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair.</p>
<p>At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalistic world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The “punk” in Solarpunk is about rebellion, counterculture, post-capitalism, decolonialism and enthusiasm. It is about going in a different direction than the mainstream, which is increasingly going in a scary direction.</p>
<p>Solarpunk is a movement as much as it is a genre: it is not just about the stories, it is also about how we can get there.</p>
<p>Solarpunk embraces a diversity of tactics: there is no single right way to do solarpunk. Instead, diverse communities from around the world adopt the name and the ideas, and build little nests of self-sustaining revolution.</p>
<p>Solarpunk provides a valuable new perspective, a paradigm and a vocabulary through which to describe one possible future. Instead of embracing retrofuturism, solarpunk looks completely to the future. Not an alternative future, but a possible future.</p>
<p>Our futurism is not nihilistic like cyberpunk and it avoids steampunk’s potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community.</p>
<p>Solarpunk emphasizes environmental sustainability and social justice.</p>
<p>Solarpunk is about finding ways to make life more wonderful for us right now, and also for the generations that follow us.</p>
<p>Our future must involve repurposing and creating new things from what we already have. Imagine “smart cities” being junked in favor of smart citizenry.</p>
<p>Solarpunk recognizes the historical influence politics and science fiction have had on each other.</p>
<p>Solarpunk recognizes science fiction as not just entertainment but as a form of activism.</p>
<p>Solarpunk wants to counter the scenarios of a dying earth, an insuperable gap between rich and poor, and a society controlled by corporations. Not in hundreds of years, but within reach.</p>
<p>Solarpunk is about youth maker culture, local solutions, local energy grids, ways of creating autonomous functioning systems. It is about loving the world.</p>
<p>Solarpunk culture includes all cultures, religions, abilities, sexes, genders and sexual identities.</p>
<p>Solarpunk is the idea of humanity achieving a social evolution that embraces not just mere tolerance, but a more expansive compassion and acceptance.</p>
<p>The visual aesthetics of Solarpunk are open and evolving. As it stands, it is a mash-up of the following:</p>
<p>1800s age-of-sail/frontier living (but with more bicycles)</p>
<p>Creative reuse of existing infrastructure (sometimes post-apocalyptic, sometimes present-weird)</p>
<p>Appropriate technology</p>
<p>Art Nouveau</p>
<p>Hayao Miyazaki</p>
<p>Jugaad-style innovation from the non-Western world</p>
<p>High-tech backends with simple, elegant outputs</p>
<p>Solarpunk is set in a future built according to principles of New Urbanism or New Pedestrianism and environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Solarpunk envisions a built environment creatively adapted for solar gain, amongst other things, using different technologies. The objective is to promote self sufficiency and living within natural limits.</p>
<p>In Solarpunk we’ve pulled back just in time to stop the slow destruction of our planet. We’ve learned to use science wisely, for the betterment of our life conditions as part of our planet. We’re no longer overlords. We’re caretakers. We’re gardeners.</p>
<p>Solarpunk:</p>
<p>is diverse</p>
<p>has room for spirituality and science to coexist</p>
