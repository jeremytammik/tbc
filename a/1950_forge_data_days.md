> Formés au Centre national des arts du cirque, Jean-Paul Lefeuvre et Didier André ... ces deux circassiens ont étayé leur univers jusqu'à créer en 2001 <i>La Serre</i>, spectacle poético-agricole ... Dans un univers ingénieux, ces "Buster Keaton" de l'horticulture parsèment d'humour absurde et de rêverie aérienne leur grande humanité.
