<h3>Forge RVT to IFC, ADN Xtra, TBC and AdnRme Updates</h3>
<p>I already described how I installed Revit 2019,
<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/compiling-the-revit-2019-sdk-samples.html">compiled the Revit 2019 SDK samples</a>
and <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/04/revitlookup-2019-and-new-sdk-samples.html">migrated RevitLookup</a> to
the new version.</p>
<p>I now migrated some of the other basic samples and utilities and have some Forge news to share:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">The Building Coder samples for Revit 2019</a> </li>
<li><a href="#3">The <code>AdnRme</code> MEP HVAC and electrical samples for Revit 2019</a> </li>
<li><a href="#4">AdnRevitApiLabsXtra for Revit 2019</a> </li>
<li><a href="#5">Convert RVT to IFC via Forge</a></li>
<li><a href="#6">Forge accelerators</a> </li>
<li><a href="#7">Forge webinars</a></li>
<li><a href="#8">Open Position for an Infrastructure BIM Implementation Consultant in Northern Europe</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>The Building Coder Samples for Revit 2019</h4>
<p>The migration of <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples">The Building Coder samples</a> to
Revit 2019 was just as trivial as RevitLookup.</p>
<ul>
<li>Update the .NET framework target version to 4.7</li>
<li>Point the Revit API assembly references to the new DLLs.</li>
</ul>
<p>No code changes were needed.</p>
<p>That does generate <a href="zip/tbc_samples_2019_errors_warnings_1.txt">six warning messages about deprecated Revit API usage</a>.</p>
<p>They all occur in the module <code>CmdGetMaterials.cs</code> and concern the use of the <code>AssetProperties</code> <code>[]</code> operator taking integer and string arguments, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>warning CS0618: 'AssetProperties.this[int]' is obsolete: This property is deprecated in Revit 2019 and will be removed in the next version of Revit. We suggest you use the 'FindByName(String)' or 'Get(int)' method instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will ignore them for the time being.</p>
<p>The flat migrated version is <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.0">release 2019.0.138.0</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/compare/2018.0.138.4...2019.0.138.0">diff between the last 2018 version, 2018.0.138.4, and 2019.0.138.0</a>,
shows the minimal changes I made.</p>
<p>To add the final finishing touch, I also updated the readme file with new Revit and .NET framework version badges.</p>
<p>The current version is <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/releases/tag/2019.0.138.1">2019.0.138.1</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a>The AdnRme MEP HVAC and Electrical Samples for Revit 2019</h4>
<p>Similarly, I updated the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme">AdnRme MEP HVAC and electrical samples</a> for Revit 2019.</p>
<p>The flat migration is captured in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.0">release 2019.0.0.0</a>, 
and I added badges here as well in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRme/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1">release 2019.0.0.1</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>AdnRevitApiLabsXtra for Revit 2019</h4>
<p>Next, I migrated the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra">AdnRevitApiLabsXtra</a> with similar ease.</p>
<p>No code changes required &ndash; again, just updated the .NET framework version and the Revit API assembly DLL references.</p>
<p>The current version is <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/AdnRevitApiLabsXtra/releases/tag/2019.0.0.1">2019.0.0.1</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Convert RVT to IFC via Forge</h4>
<p>Looking toward the future making use of web-based component technology,
<a href="https://github.com/simonmoreau">Simon Moreau</a> of <a href="https://www.bouygues-immobilier.com">Bouygues Immobilier</a>, author of the <a href="http://bim42.com">BIM42 blog</a>,
shared his nice new <a href="https://github.com/simonmoreau/RevitToIFC">RevitToIFC web app</a>.</p>
<p>Revit To IFC is a web application using
the <a href="https://autodesk-forge.github.io">Autodesk Forge</a> web
services to convert Revit file to the IFC format.
You can use it to upload a Revit file to Forge and download back the resulting converted file.</p>
