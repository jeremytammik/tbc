16:31:08	 From Jeremy Tammik to Andreas Fleischmann, All Panelists : Yes. You can use Forge Design Automation API for Revit to generate, save and download RFA.
16:31:37	 From Jeremy Tammik : Q: will there be any library for developers to create rfa files, similar to opendwg?

16:59:24	 From Christopher Maltez to Panelists : @jemeytammik, @mikako. I am referring to the app review team in India that reviews normal typical revit apps. i would respond in the question in the q&a but zoom doesn't seem to let me respond. it seems only panelists can respond.
17:00:24	 From Anna Lazar : @Christopher Maltez - Josh and I can help you navigate QA/QC with the India team. Please email us with your question and we can help in you during PST time zones
17:00:31	 From Andreas Fleischmann : as you know, we are developers of elevator software and might have a web version of it. USers can quickly customize an elevator in the web browser.
