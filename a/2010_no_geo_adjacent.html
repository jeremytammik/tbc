- The BIM has No Geometry
  [Simplify elements geometry](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/simplify-elements-geometry/m-p/12266629)
  **Question:** I am trying to simfplify the geometry of elements (such as cylinders, shperes, etc.) throgh the API.
  My first idea was simple:
  1. Retrieve a mesh from all faces with low quality using face.Triangulate(0);
  2. Apply the new mesh for element's geometry.
  However, it does not work. I have seen messages on the forum stating that working with geometry through the API is not allowed. Anyway, I believe that there it should be another approach to tackle this issue. I would appreciate any help.
  **Answer:** No. There is no way that you can specify Revit element geometry. Please bear in mind that Revit is a BIM authoring tool. The BIM is completely driven by parameters and constraints.
  There is no geometry in the BIM!
  The model as you see it (and its geometry) is just a view of the elements, their relationships, parameters and constraints.

- generative ai use and misuse
  [How people can create &ndash; and destroy &ndash; value with generative AI](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/how-people-create-and-destroy-value-with-gen-ai)
  Key Takeaways &ndash; A first-of-its-kind scientific experiment finds that people mistrust generative AI in areas where it can contribute tremendous value and trust it too much where the technology isn’t competent:
  Around 90% of participants improved their performance when using GenAI for creative ideation. People did best when they did not attempt to edit GPT-4’s output.
  When working on business problem solving, a task outside the tool’s current competence, many participants took GPT-4's misleading output at face value. Their performance was 23% worse than those who didn’t use the tool at all.
  Adopting generative AI is a massive change management effort. The job of the leader is to help people use the new technology in the right way, for the right tasks and to continually adjust and adapt in the face of GenAI’s ever-expanding frontier.

<h4><a name="3"></a> The BIM has No Geometry</h4>
<p>One fundamental and possibly surprising aspect of the BIM: it has no geometry.
This came up in the thread on how
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/simplify-elements-geometry/m-p/12266629">simplify elements geometry</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am trying to simplify the geometry of elements such as cylinders, spheres, etc. through the API.
My first idea was simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve a mesh from all faces with low quality using <code>face.Triangulate(0)</code></li>
<li>Apply the new mesh to the element geometry</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it does not work.
I have seen messages on the forum stating that working with geometry through the API is not allowed.

<h4><a name="4"></a> Get Touching Elements</h4>
<p>In spite of that, we keep running into task that are inimately related to the BIM element geometry, such as
the <a href="#5">retrieval of cut edges between intersecting elements discussed below</a> and the task
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/get-touching-elements/m-p/12223781">get touching elements</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I want to get the slabs that are on the edge of a beam as shown in this figure:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/touching_elements.png" alt="Touching elements" title="Touching elements" width="600"/>
</center></p>
<p>How can I get these slabs?
<code>ElementIntersectsElement</code> and <code>ElementIntersectsSolid</code> don't work in this case.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You should be able to use <code>ElementIntersectsSolid</code> with a slightly enlarged solid.</p>
<p>If your beam is aligned with one of the cardinal axes, you could even use a <code>BoundingBoxIntersectsFilter</code> instead, which is a quick filter.
Just make the bounding box a bit bigger than the beam.</p>
<p>If worst comes to worst, you can also use the <code>ReferenceIntersector</code> to shoot rays from the beam to detect the neighbouring slab.</p>
<p>Finally, though, and best of all, 11 years ago, The Building Coder presented a solution
to <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/09/filter-for-touching-beams-using-solid-intersection.html">filter for touching beams using solid intersection</a></p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you, that solution helped a lot.
I made a solution where I used the location line and some transform functions.
Then, the <code>solid.IntersectsWithCurve</code> method enabled me to retrieve the slabs.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> What is a Stable Representation of a Reference?</h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the BIM database does store any geometry.
And yet, the BIM annotation contains database elements such as dimensioning that refer to the geometry, and even to geometry sub-elements such as cut edges generated by element intersection.</p>
<p>How can that be?</p>
<p>Well, the dimensioning requires a reference, and since the reference itself disappears when the geometry is gone, Revit uses the concept of a stable representation of the reference to store information about which reference we mean, even if the geometry is gone,
cf., e.g., this brief explanation
of <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/selecting-a-face-in-a-linked-file.html#1">reference and stable representation</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a> CUT_EDGE Reference Voodoo</h4>
<p>Joseph Tenenbaum shares a new application of stable reference magic voodoo in his solution
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/retrieve-cut-edge-references-from-walls/m-p/12278698">retrieve <code>CUT_EDGE</code> references from walls</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am trying to get the CUT_EDGE references of a given wall using the API. At the moment I can get part of the references based on the Wall geometry. I first go to the Solids and for each edge of the solid I check if the Reference is of type CUT_EDGE. This works but does not get all the options (I see more when generating a dimension line manually in the UI of Revit).</p>
<p>For example, I have the wall seen in this image:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/cut_edge_voodoo_2.png" alt="CUT_EDGE reference stable representation" title="CUT_EDGE reference stable representation" width="100"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 253
Pixel Width: 514 -->
</center></p>
<p>The dimension is attached to the following <code>CUT_EDGE</code> references:</p>
<ul>
<li>3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/0/1</li>
<li>3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/1/1</li>
</ul>
<p>But when I run over all the edges of the wall, I only get the following options:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/cut_edge_voodoo_1.png" alt="CUT_EDGE reference stable representation" title="CUT_EDGE reference stable representation" width="100"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 253
Pixel Width: 514 -->
</center></p>
<p>I played already with the visibility and detail options, and <code>IncludeNonVisibleObjects</code>, and nothing helps.</p>
<p>I think knowing better what the structure of the stable representations mean could help a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Here is my finding that actually worked, for example using the Stable Representation 3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f:8:CUT_EDGE/0/1.</p>
<ul>
<li>3aecdde0-f1aa-42b2-a208-f740e7a17720-003f7f7f: Refers to the element itself</li>
<li>8: Is the ID of the face of the Revit <code>Element</code></li>
<li>CUT_EDGE/0/1: This is the type and location of the Reference. It is CUT_EDGE type,  the <code>1</code> means which edge of the face, and the <code>0</code> is its end-point index.</li>
</ul>
<p>My original findings were correct; I was just missing the index of the end-point of the edge I found. All this is possible to find via the Edges of the Solids that are part of the geometry of an Element.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Joseph for his research and clear explanation!</p>
