  nice visualizations - makes a boring dataset bias examination much more engaging!
  Content is great! I love the look and feel as well.
  Loved it, this part is probably my favorite:

[Models All The Way Down](https://knowingmachines.org/models-all-the-way) by Christo Buschek and Jer Thorp
presents an in-depth analysis of the sources used to generate the huge amount of material required to train an LLM, presented in a novel and engaging fashion with lots of visualisation and animation, making an otherwise possibly boring dataset bias examination much more engaging.
In particular, it examines the ubiquitous LAION-5B dataset:
