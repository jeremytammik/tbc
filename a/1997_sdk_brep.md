### BRepBuilder and Toposurface Interior

An updated Revit SDK, an in-depth discussion of Revit geometry generation, a Toposurface issue and a hint at where the software development industry may be headed:

- [Revit SDK Update](#1)
- [BRepBuilder organisation](#2)
- [Change Toposurface interior point to boundary](#3)
- [To code or not to code, that is the question](#4)

####<a name="1"></a> Revit SDK Update

The age-old `developrevit` [Revit Developer Centre](http://autodesk.com/developrevit) shortcut
now redirects to a new target aligned with the rest of the Autodesk Platform Service APS APIs,
to

- [aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/revit](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/revit)

We also updated the Revit SDK for Revit 2024 on May 30, 2023, to fix some of the issues I
described in April [compiling the Revit 2024 SDK samples](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/04/nice-accelerator-and-compiling-the-revit-2024-sdk.html#3) and
subsequently reported in the ticket REVIT-206304 *Update RvtSamples.txt for Revit 2024 SDK*.

why [BRepBuilder fails on very simple example](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/brepbuilder-fails-on-very-simple-example/m-p/12015942):

**Question:** I get a "Failure" result on a very simple BRepBuilder example when I try to build a (4-sided triangle pyramid) Tetrahedron.
I know about `TessellatedShapeBuilder`, but it fails for a quite complex object, and I hope to bypass this using the BREP instead.

**Answer:** [DirectShape from BrepBuilder and Boolean](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2018/02/directshape-from-brepbuilder-and-boolean.html) provides
an example that does work.

However, please note that BRepBuilder wasnâ€™t really meant for 'manually' constructing geometry. Its interface is rather cumbersome for that purpose. It was meant for translating existing geometry into Revit, with rather thorough validation of the input geometry.

**Response:** I implemented a workaround using `TesselatedShapeBuilder`, but it's strange that I can't get the simplest example working with the BREP commands. Also, the error message is not very helpful.

Later: I experienced the same error when try to create a simple pyramid shape as a prototype for recreating geometry from linked IFC file. I would like to use some external algorithm the geometry and convert the external data to a mesh and rebuilt the new shape. The API documentation does not provide much of information about why it failed.

**Answer:** It takes a bit of organisation but it does work.

It isn't ideal for manual creation since (1) you need to arrange the edges so they are compatible and (2) the edges need to sit on the surface.

I organised the above original into the below edge orders and directions and it worked fine. Each co-edge should be reversed on one face and not reversed on the other. Outer loops for a face should be anticlockwise with respect to the face normal (pointing outwards for a solid). So the edge is indicated as reversed on the face if it can't satisfy that e.g. the edge of two adjoining faces needs to be reversed on one of them.

**Response:** It took me a while to figure out how the edges and faces should be added before the detail explanation and sample code reaches me.
Thank you very much for your effort.

That is a really cool image; did you create it or you found in some Revit API presentation?

Is kinda missing a Four-sided dice in that image ðŸ˜€

Another thing that is good to mention, is if your BRepType is Void, all the face normals must point into the void.

**Answer:** Thanks @ricaun I drew it with AutoCAD after a couple of attempts at what I wanted to get across using pencil, paper and eraser (more eraser than pencil and paper).

I'll have to check how important it is to set the boundaries of the surfaces.
I'm sure I noticed previously and the other day that just specifying null may create a performance issue in Revit after the direct shape exists.

The best thing about the BRepBuilder in my view is that you can create single face solids. So all those API functions specific to the face class can be used on such.

**Answer:** Regarding the boundaries, you say:

> I'll have to check how important it is to set the boundaries of the surfaces. I'm sure I noticed previously and the other day that just specifying null may create a performance issue in Revit after the direct shape exists.

In my code, the boundaries of the surfaces are null as well, never have a problem but the most complex thing I did was create a copy of a Solid to change the Material. Works, but reordering and reversing each edge is painful.

> @RPTHOMAS108 wrote: The best thing about the BRepBuilder in my view is that you can create single face solids. So all those API functions specific to the face class can be used on such.

For a simple face, it is possible to use `TessellatedShapeBuilder`: you can create a Solid, or a Mesh if that fails.

In this `D4` is much simpler to use than TessellatedFace &ndash; `D4` as in tetrahedron, a shape with 4 flat faces, a dice with 4 faces, or a `D4` if you are familiar with dice and RPG. ðŸ˜€

<pre class="prettyprint">
var shapeBuilder
  = TessellatedShapeCreatorUtils.Create(
    builder =&gt;
  {
    var points = new List&lt;XYZ&gt;(4);
    points.Add(new XYZ(0, 0, 0)); // 0 origin
    points.Add(new XYZ(1, 0, 0)); // 1 right
    points.Add(new XYZ(0, 1, 0)); // 2 back
    points.Add(new XYZ(0, 0, 1)); // 3 top

    var materialId = ElementId.InvalidElementId;
    // bottom face
    builder.AddFace(new TessellatedFace(new[] {
      points[2], points[1], points[0] }, materialId));
    // front face
    builder.AddFace(new TessellatedFace(new[] {
      points[0], points[1], points[3] }, materialId));
    // diagonal face
    builder.AddFace(new TessellatedFace(new[] {
      points[1], points[2], points[3] }, materialId));
    // left face
    builder.AddFace(new TessellatedFace(new[] {
      points[2], points[0], points[3] }, materialId));
  });
</pre>

Here is
the [full code of TessellatedShapeCreatorUtils.cs implementing this utility class](https://gist.github.com/ricaun/35baa2ed9f33de3487e46e4217b5e8bd)

<pre class="prettyprint">
public static class TessellatedShapeCreatorUtils
{
  public static TessellatedShapeBuilderResult Create(
    Action&lt;TessellatedShapeBuilder&gt; actionBuilder)
  {
    TessellatedShapeBuilder builder = new TessellatedShapeBuilder();
    builder.Target = TessellatedShapeBuilderTarget.AnyGeometry;
    builder.Fallback = TessellatedShapeBuilderFallback.Mesh;
    builder.OpenConnectedFaceSet(true);
    actionBuilder?.Invoke(builder);
    builder.CloseConnectedFaceSet();
    builder.Build();
    TessellatedShapeBuilderResult result = builder.GetBuildResult();
    return result;
  }
}

If you are working with a Revit surface, `BRepBuilder` is the way to go.

Many thanks to Richard and Luiz Henrique for the good advice, illuminating discussion and great sample code!

Supervised a project 2 week ago.
Two programmers were hired to create an MVP.
I have worked with both before:

- Alex from Germany. 100% code. 19 years experience.
- Hamid from Pakistan. Code + Copilot + GPT-4 + no-code. 4 years experience.

What do you think happened?

Both programmers received Figma screens and detailed specs.
A designer was available to assist them with the assets they needed, and there was also existing code that needed to be integrated.
Hamid finished the first version in one week with 100% test coverage of code and end-to-end testing of no-code parts.
95% of the work seems to be finished and appears to work at first glance... ðŸ˜²
Hamid built the UI and front-end workflows in bubble, generated Cloudflare Workers using GPT-4, integrated existing code using Copilot, and generated tests using GPT-4 (playwright/ava).

Hamid's costs:

- GPT-4: $211
- Copilot: $20
- Cloudflare: $5
- Bubble: $134
- Compensation: $2460 (41 hours worked)
- Costs to host/run: $139/mo

Alex finished around 7% of the tasks. Costs:

- Vercel: $20
- Compensation: $3500
- Estimated to developing everything: $45k. And expects $11k for adding tests.
- Costs to host/run: $20/mo

This was a project I supervised for a friend of mine with an agency.
I only did it because I was really curious about how it would turn out.

We both thought that Hamid would be finished in 8-10 weeks while Alex would take a week or two extra, but the results amazed us!

He had a talk with Alex about this. His response? "But it will be so much cheaper to run this app, and you'll have everything under control." Not understanding the opportunity costs of shipping 13 times slower and 25 times more expensive to develop.

Alex was let go because he wants to "code" and doesn't trust no-code/AI...

The development agency of my friend has 100+ developers like Alex.
Now he is going to retrain or replace them with developers like Hamid...

I think people like Hamid will still have work five years from now, while people like Alex will have to find other jobs/professions.
What do you think?
