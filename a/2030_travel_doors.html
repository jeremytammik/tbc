<h4><a name="3"></a> Doors Traversed by Path of Travel</h4>
<p>A while ago, I took a look at determining the doors traversed by a path of travel and shared some thoughts on that in
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/PathOfTravelDoors">PathOfTravelDoors GitHub repo</a>.</p>
<p>They were picked up again in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/doors-traversed-on-path-of-travel-lines/td-p/12616109">doors traversed on path of travel lines</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I want to list all the doors that are crossed by a path of travel line.
I tried to code that, but it seems that the <code>ReferenceIntersector</code> finds more doors that are not on the path of travel, because the introduced ray is reaching them.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/path_of_travel_doors.png" alt="Path of travel doors" title="Path of travel doors" width="600"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 622 Pixel Width: 1,152 -->
</center></p>
<p>I looked at the Revit SDK sample PathOfTravel, but that does not help.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/c4fb6c89-ca34-7c56-b730-98755d11fedf.htm">ReferenceIntersector documentation</a> is illuminating, and
the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/866e1f2b-c79a-4d9f-1db1-9e386dd42941.htm">FindNearest method</a> ought
to ensure that I only get a maximum of one single intersected door.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Hmm. Maybe, this task can be addressed simpler.
How about this approach without using the reference intersector at all?</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrieve the path of travel curve tessellation</li>
<li>For each line segment, determine whether it intersects a door</li>
</ul>
<p>Afaict, that should solve the problem right there.
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Just cracked it an hour ago!
I tackled it with this trick:
For each curve in the path of travel line I did once from the start point following the curve's direction, and once from the endpoint with the reversed direction.
Then, I accepted the points that appeared in both.</p>
<p>I also thought of another approach as you mentioned: generating an imaginary line at each door location and checking whether the path of travel line segments intersects that.
However, this method required finding the two points of each door, possibly by examining the geometry of a wall for its opening.
While it seems plausible, I decided against pursuing it initially due to its complexity.</p>
<p>Later: Unfortunately, the described technique fails to yield the intended results across certain models, resulting in a null output from the <code>ReferenceIntersector</code>.</p>
<p>As a workaround for those specific models, an alternative approach was employed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract the start and end points of each line from the door geometry instance</li>
<li>Construct an imaginary line corresponding to the door location (the bounding box includes door swing, so not proper for my case)</li>
<li>Examine the intersection of this imaginary line with the curves of the path of travel lines</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
Glad to hear that you found an approach that works reliably for all door instances.</p>
<p>I cannot say for sure why the reference intersector fails in some cases.
One thing to consider, though, is that a content creator has complete freedom in the family definition.
So, some content creators might choose to represent doors in a completely unconventional manner.
They might define the door geometry so that no solids or faces exist for the reference intersector to detect, which might lead to such failures.
The infinite flexibility provided for Revit family definitions can make it hard to ensure that an approach always covers all cases.
This makes unit testing on a large collection of possible BIM variations all the more important.</p>
<p>The approach you describe is very generic: every door opening is defined by one single line from start to end point, and that line must be crossed to pass through the door.
That sounds pretty fool-proof to me.</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Camera Mapping Between APS and Revit</h4>
<p>In 2019, Eason Kang shared a very helpful explanation on how
to <a href="https://aps.autodesk.com/blog/map-forge-viewer-camera-back-revit">map Forge viewer camera back to Revit</a>.</p>
<p>However, some aspects changed, and some were left uncovered back then, as discussed in
the new <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/revit-3d-view-camera-settings/m-p/12629132">Revit 3D view camera settings</a>.</p>
<p>So, Eason took another deep dive into the topic, researched, tested, organized all the material and published it in two blog posts:</p>
