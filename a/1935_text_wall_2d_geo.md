### Detailed Wall Layer and 2D Text Geometry

Determining the extents of a text element has been a recurring and challenging task with several tricky solutions suggested in the past, e.g.:

The advent of the 2D custom exporter provides a possibility for a nbew approach to address this:

####<a name="2"></a> Retrieve Dimension Text Height and Width

The latest question in this series asks how to determine
[the height and width of the dimension text ](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/the-height-and-width-of-the-dimension-text/m-p/10873262):

**Question: When dimension text overlaps, I want to move one of the dimensions to avoid the overlap.
My idea is to calculate the rectangular border of the text through the position of the text and the width and height of the text, and then judge whether the rectangular borders intersect.
So, how to calculate the width and height of dimension text?

**Answer:** That should be possible using the approaches described in these two other recent threads:

Look at these two recent threads here in the forum:

Haroon Haider describes his successful approach to access text font geometry in 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on [converting text to geometry when performing a 2D view export](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/converting-text-to-geometry-when-performing-a-2d-view-export/m-p/10201712):

**Question:** We have been able to get access to the lines, grids, annotations and other basic elements of a 2D view using the `IExportContext2D` interface.
Is there a way to convert the annotation text from strings to geometry using Revit API similar to how you can do in AutoCAD? 
I'm looking to get something like this:

<center>
<img src="img/text_font_geom.png" alt="Text font geometry" title="Text font geometry" width="223"/> <!-- 223 -->
</center>

**Answer:**: I ended up getting what I need by processing a `TextNode` from the export context method `OnText` call.
There is enough information in the text node class to be able to convert it to a `GraphicsPath` and pull out the geometry from there.

Many thanks to Haroon for sharing this!

shares a generic solution to retrieve the 2D geometry of any element in the thread 
on [view reference location](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/view-reference-location/m-p/10867150):

**Question:** I am making a simple tool to add a leader annotation symbol to a View Reference, but have run into a bit of an issue.
In RevitLookup, it doesn't appear that the location of a View Reference is defined anywhere in the API.
Looking through the API docs as well, I can't find a class for View Reference either, which makes me think that its properties aren't accessible.
Am I missing something?
Obviously, a simple workaround is to just have the user click a start and end point, but ideally I'd like to have the start be defined by the View Reference location.

**Answer:** The Revit API supports exactly (and only) two data types for the Location property: `LocationPoint` and `LocationCurve`.
Some elements have different kinds of location definitions that do not fit into either of these two.
In that case, they are not accessible in the API, just as you surmised.
Is the view reference location visible in any way in the end user interface?
What does it look like in that context?
Is there any reason why it might be considered something that does not fit into a point or a curve?

In general, classes that show up as `Element` in RevitLookup have no specific API functionality beyond the element base class.

As the location of the element it not exposed, nor is the geometry, you have two options:

- Centre of BoundingBox, or
- Implement `IExportContext2D` and gather the geometry via that.

I would do the latter as it gives you more control.

- Use `OnElementBegin2D` to check the id against the element you want to look at; then pass `Skip` or `Proceed` depending on whether your id matches.
- `OnCurve` will give you details of curves (called for each).
- `OnText` will give you details of text.

Note that this will happen regardless of what you set for `RenderNodeAction` in `OnElementBegin2D`.
The best way to avoid calling `OnText` for text elements you are not interested in is to do as follows:

- During `OnElementBegin2d`, store the `ElemendId` as a variable
- During `OnElementEnd2d` set the `ElementId` variable to `InvalidElementId`
- During `OnText` exit the sub if variable is not set to `InvalidElementId`

To export text, you also need to set `Export2DIncludingAnnotationObjects` to true.

I'm finding the best approach is to implement `IExportContext2D` via a general class and then inherit that.
This avoids having to implement all the members each time and you can build in some filtering similar to above:

<pre class="code">
Imports Autodesk.Revit.DB

#End Region

End Class
</pre>

A lot of the members are not called for the 2D scenario.

Here is a correction required to `OnText`, i.e., check the list of filtered contains the current id.

<pre class="code">
 Public Sub OnText(node As TextNode) Implements IExportContextBase.OnText
    If FilterEIDs IsNot Nothing Then
      If FilterEIDs.Contains(IntCurrentEID) = False Then
        Exit Sub
      End If
    End If

    OnText_Overridable(node)
End Sub
</pre>

The best way to understand the order of the exporter method calls is to log them.

**Response:** Thanks so much!
That's a clever implementation of `IExportContext2d`.
Appreciate the help!
