<h4><a name="3"></a>Avoid Using ElementTransformUtils for Batches</h4>
<p>The <code>ElementTransformUtils</code> <code>MoveElement</code> method has an important performance issue when used on a large number of elements, as pointed out by Revitalizer in 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/is-there-a-batch-method-for-placing-adaptive-component-points/m-p/7672487">a batch method for placing adaptive component points</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I have a performance issue placing and moving adaptive components using the following code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  # place family instance, get default placement points,
  # subtract from my desired coordinates (list) and move element

  inst = AdaptiveComponentInstanceUtils.CreateAdaptiveComponentInstance(
    doc, inst)

  placePointIds = []

  placePointIds = AdaptiveComponentInstanceUtils.GetInstancePlacementPointElementRefIds(
    inst)

  for ind, item in enumerate(placePointIds):

    # assign a point object to refpt
    # refpt is the orginal point of the family
    # newpt the new point derived from pt information

    refpt = doc.GetElement(item)

    newpt = pt[ind]

    trans = newpt.Subtract(refpt.Position)

    ElementTransformUtils.MoveElement(doc, item, trans)
</pre>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> There is a performance problem with <code>ElementTransformUtils</code>, as pointed out in the thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/elementtransformutils-performance-issue/m-p/5775624">ElementTransformUtils: performance issue</a>.</p>
<p>It seems to auto regenerate after each movement.</p>
<p>In that case, you have to move every point separately. If the bad performance issue is related to the <code>ElementTransformUtils</code> methods, this might give better performance. To know for sure, you'd have to test.</p>
<p>Maybe you can use <code>SetCoordinateSystem</code> instead:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  (refpt as ReferencePoint).SetCoordinateSystem()
</pre>

<p>Fleshed out a bit more, it could look like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  Element refpt = doc.GetElement(item);
  XYZ newpt = pt[ind];
  Transform tf = Transform.Identity;
  tf.Origin = newpt;
  (refpt as ReferencePoint).SetCoordinateSystem(tf);
</pre>

<p><strong>Response:</strong> Hey, awesome!!! It works! Performance is way better and the code runs fluid!</p>
<p>I suppose this is even better than moving components, although I would be interested to compare both methods once it is fixed.</p>
<p>My code now looks like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
  placePointIds = AdaptiveComponentInstanceUtils.GetInstancePlacementPointElementRefIds(
    inst):

  for ind, item in enumerate(placePointIds):
    refpt = doc.GetElement(item)
    newpt = pt[ind]
    tf = Transform.Identity
    tf.Origin = newpt
    refpt.SetCoordinateSystem(tf);
</pre>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Finding Cause of DirectShape Generation Problem</h4>
<p>Revitalizer provided more important hints on detecting problems in 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on a <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/problem-with-solid-creation-by-tessellatedshapebuilder/m-p/7678156">problem with solid creation by <code>TessellatedShapeBuilder</code></a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I want to import some solids created by an external library into Revit with TessellatedShapeBuilder.</p>
<p>All solids are correctly tessellated and closed.</p>
<p>But I got sometimes the following error on calling <code>TessellatedShapeBuilder.Build</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could not create consistent vertex list</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as I know there are some restriction about triangles, e.g., the distance between two vertices.</p>
<p>I could merge two vertices in this case.</p>
<p>But I don't know any other restriction, and how could I adjust my vertex list and triangle list to avoid the above error?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The problem might indeed be due to vertices lying too close together; they need to
be <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/directshape-performance-and-minimum-size.html">at least about 2 mm apart</a>.</p>
<p>What I always do in these kind of cases:</p>
<p>While reading the input vertices one by one, I put them into a dictionary equipped with an <code>XYZ</code> comparison operator.</p>
<p>If a new vertex is very close to an existing one, my comparison operator considers the two vertices to be equal, so I ignore it and use the existing one instead.</p>
<p>The <code>GetVertices</code> method
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/CmdNestedInstanceGeo.cs#L30-L85">The Building Coder samples CmdNestedInstanceGeo.cs</a> does
something similar using an <code>XyzEqualityComparer</code>.</p>
<p>You would simply have to replace the face vertex index of any ignored vertex by the index of its replacement.</p>
<p>There is also an <code>Appliation.MinimumThickness</code> property. It says in
the <a href="http://www.revitapidocs.com/2018.1/8bff8d69-bc8d-b0ea-ed2f-6af1bed07e75.htm">Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The minimum thickness allowed in Revit for a variety of geometric constructs. These include blends, extrusions, and wall layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever problem you run into, try reproducing the same issue manually through the user interface.</p>
<p>That will probably provide more information on what the problem is than the Revit API does.</p>
<p>You should also have a look at <code>TessellatedShapeBuilderResult.GetIssuesForFaceSet</code>.</p>
<p>In fact, it may localize exactly the faces and vertices causing the problem.</p>
<p>Each <code>TesselatedBuildIssue</code> provides a <code>GetDescription</code> method.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a>Addendum</h4>
<p>Rudi disagrees with my statement in the introduction above and corrects it, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for mentioning me in the current TBC post!</p>
<p>I must admit that for both topics (ElementTransformUtils and DirectShape), I could not help the people, in fact:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the ElementTransformUtils method, FAIR59 provided the solution (SetCoordinateSystem), but he isn't even mentioned on TBC.</li>
<li>For the DirectShape problem, the user said that he already checked my suggestions, without any success.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I still think Rudi's suggestions are helpful and important and worth highlighting.</p>
<p>Many thanks to FAIR59 as well, of course, as so often before in the past couple of months.</p>
