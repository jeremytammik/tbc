- compare element
  Chuong Ho
  It's been a while since our last Revit Add-in manager update, but we've got some exciting news to share today!
  I thrilled to introduce a new tool that's now part of the Add-in manager. This tool is a game-changer for both developers and users as it allows you to easily compare differences between two elements. Not only that, but it also uses color to visually highlight all parameter variations, making it incredibly intuitive and user-friendly. Plus, you can view the similarity results of value comparisons between parameters from those two elements
  Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to experience a whole new level of efficiency with our latest addition to the Revit Add-in manager!"

- Revit database explorer (RDBE)
  https://github.com/NeVeSpl/RevitDBExplorer
  mentioned last year
  https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/immutable-uniqueid-and-revit-database-explorer.html#3
  The fastest, most advanced, asynchronous Revit database exploration tool for Revit 2021+.**
  Yet another [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) like tool. RevitLookup was an indispensable tool to work with Revit API for many years. But now, there is a better tool for the job. Let me introduce you to RDBE and its capabilities. RDBE not only allows us to explore database in a more efficient way thanks to querying, but also to modify Revit database through ad hoc scripts written in C#.

  You can always use an alternative tool that offers access to Extensible Storage Scheme. (:

<h4><a name="4"></a> The Shapely Python 2D Geometry Library</h4>
<p>Jake of <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3926242">Ripcord Engineering</a> recently
shared a bunch of valuable <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/07/export-gbxml-and-python-tips.html">Python and gbXML tips</a>.
Discussing a solution
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/gbxml-from-adjacent-conceptual-mass-adjacent-space-missing-small/m-p/12238726">gbXML from adjacent conceptual mass or space missing small surface</a>,
he now added a pointer
to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/shapely/">Shapely</a>,
a powerful-looking Python 2D geometry library for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the Cartesian plane.
For instance, it includes support for 2D Booleans
and <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/set_operations.html">set operations</a>.
In this context, the Python <a href="https://pypi.org/project/xgbxml/">xgbxml library</a> looks
like another very handy tool.</p>
<h4><a name="4.1"></a> Shapely Finds and Fixes a Hole</h4>
<p>Jake added: I'm happy to report <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html">Shapely</a> was
able to find a missing 'small' surface (hole) in the 'Mass' demo file attached
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/gbxml-from-adjacent-conceptual-mass-adjacent-space-missing-small/m-p/12253611">this thread</a>. To find XY plane holes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make Space surface polygons
  with <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon">shapely.Polygon</a></li>
<li>Make Space polygons from Space surface polygons
  with <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.union_all.html#shapely.union_all">shapely.union_all</a></li>
<li>Make Level surface polygons from Space polygons
  with <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.union_all.html#shapely.union_all">shapely.union_all</a></li>
<li>Ask shapely for
  the <a href="https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/shapely.Polygon.html#shapely.Polygon">'interiors' attribute</a> for
  a sequence of rings which bound all existing holes in Level surface polygons.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next step is to correlate holes with Spaces.
This is the trickier part in my opinion.
Going in plan is to use polygons as defined by Space wall outlines as truth data.
Not sure how this will mesh with current Ripcord Engineering gbxml workflow.
Time will tell.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Jake for the great pointer and nice example.</p>
