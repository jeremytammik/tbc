<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am struggling to get my C# code correct to convert my user forms into each culture.
I tried for days, but I cannot get my labels to change languages when opening Revit in different language versions.
I can get my Ribbon Panel button to change languages using a RibbonResources.resx file in my App.cs, but my FormExport.resx files are not providing language translation values.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
public FormExport(Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document doc)
{
  CultureInfo cultureName = new CultureInfo(Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.Name);
  string cultureRef = cultureName.Name;
  Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(cultureRef);
  Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(cultureRef);

  InitializeComponent();
  familyDocument = doc;

  // Get the localized label text from the resource .resx file
  string localizedLabelText = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("lblFamilyName.Text");
  string localizedHeaderText = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("lblHeader.Text");

  // Set the label text with the localized value
  lblFamilyName.Text = localizedLabelText;
  lblHeader.Text = localizedHeaderText;
}
</pre>

<p>I have this function set below my form code:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
private string GetLocalizedTextFromResource(string key)
{
  try
  {
    // Load the appropriate resource file based on the user's selected language
    ResourceManager resourceManager = new ResourceManager("MyApp.FormExport", typeof(FormExport).Assembly);
    CultureInfo currentCulture = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture;
    // Fetch the localized text for the given key from the resource
    string localizedText = resourceManager.GetString(key, currentCulture);
    // If the resource for the given key is not found in the selected culture,
    // explicitly load the default resource (English) using CultureInfo.InvariantCulture
    if (localizedText == null)
    {
      localizedText = resourceManager.GetString(key, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    }
    // If the resource is still not found, return the key itself as a fallback
    return localizedText ?? key;
  }
  catch (MissingManifestResourceException ex)
  {
    // Log the exception
    Console.WriteLine($"Resource file not found. Exception: {ex.Message}");
    return key; // Return the key itself as a fallback
  }
}
</pre>

<p>My form <code>.resx</code> files are:</p>
<ul>
<li>FormExport.resx</li>
<li>FormExport.en.resx</li>
<li>FormExport.fr.resx</li>
<li>... (continued)</li>

<p>It has become very confusing since everyone seems to have a different method.
I am simply building a C# .Net app for Revit under the Add-in tab.
I have five WinForms.
One is a primary WinForms and the other WinForms support secondary operations.
This is all been built in Visual Studio 2022 for Revit 2021-2024.
The app has been submitted to the app store for publishing.
Now, I just need to prepare the WinForms for a larger international base of users.</p>
<p>It should be extremely simple.
Again, I have my ribbon panel working for any language, but the translations of my WinForms are my challenge.
Beyond the sites listed below, I spent hours reviewing YouTube videos, ChatGPT, reading manuals, and website blogs.
In Visual Studio, I have done the process of setting each form to 'Localizable' = true, then Language = "France, Spanish,...", customized the forms for .resx files.  I have tested with separate manual .resx files, and tons of programming methods.  Frustrating for something that is effectively a basic task.</p>
<p>I am hoping someone can provide c# .net guidance showing the code requirements of a single form that references the appropriate .resx based upon the user's Revit language version.
I currently have a <code>Forms</code> folder for all of my WinForms and their associated <code>.resx</code> language files.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The <code>.resx</code> file should swap automatically when depending on the <code>CultureInfo</code>; if the resource is now changed automatically probably your key language is different from the CultureInfo in the application, like <code>en</code> is different from <code>en-US</code> and <code>fr</code> is different from <code>fr-FR</code>.
Just update your resource file name to match the same <code>CultureInfo</code> that Revit uses.
Here is a <a href="https://github.com/ricaun/RevitAddin.ResourcesExample">table listing all the languages and keys</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> Thank you for your answer and excellent quality video of your .resx management.
Your methods will be useful on some other apps I plan to create.</p>
<p>I was finally successful at getting my C# Winforms to show in any UICulture languages!
I want to share this information with others:</p>
<h4><a name="3.1"></a> Ribbon Panel Localization</h4>
<p>I added a language switcher file based on Andrey Bushman's sample file.
This has been modified to <code>RVTLanguages.cs</code>.
The file was placed in my root folder below my C# project name.
In the same location, I also created three .resx files:</p>
<ul>
<li>RibbonResources.resx (empty &ndash; set to <code>Internal</code>)</li>
<li>RibbonResources.en-US.resx (my panel data &ndash; see image below)</li>
<li>RibbonResources.fr-FR.resx (my French translations)</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep my panel button narrow and allow for wrapping of text, I created two lines in the .resx file:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/ribbon_resx_file_en.png" alt="Ribbon panel resource file" title="Ribbon panel resource file" width="800"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 417 Pixel Width: 1,686 -->
</center></p>
<p>In my <code>App.cs</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
public Result OnStartup(UIControlledApplication application)
{

#region READ AND SET THE LANGUAGE ENVIRONMENT USING THE RVTLanguages.cs file
  RVTLanguages.Cultures(application.ControlledApplication.Language);
  ResourceManager res_mng = new ResourceManager(typeof(RibbonResources));
#endregion

  RibbonPanel p = application.CreateRibbonPanel(RibbonResources.ResourceManager.GetString("PanelName"));

  string thisAssemblyPath = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location;
  string buttonText1 = RibbonResources.ResourceManager.GetString("CommandName1");
  string buttonText2 = RibbonResources.ResourceManager.GetString("CommandName2");

  PushButtonData btnMyApp = new PushButtonData("btnMyApp", buttonText1 + "\n" + buttonText2, thisAssemblyPath, typeof(Command).FullName)
  {
    LargeImage = imgSrc,
    Image = imgSrcTB,
    LongDescription = RibbonResources.ResourceManager.GetString("CommandDescription"),
    ToolTip = RibbonResources.ResourceManager.GetString("CommandToolTip")
  };

  // set help file to reference .bundle file help.html
  string helpFolder = Path.Combine(parentFolder, "help.html");
  ContextualHelp contextHelp = new ContextualHelp(
  ContextualHelpType.ChmFile, helpFolder);
  btnMyApp.SetContextualHelp(contextHelp);

  p.AddItem(btnMyApp);
</pre>

<p>This was all that was required for setting up a localized ribbon button:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/ribbon_resx_en_and_fr.png" alt="Ribbon panel localisation" title="Ribbon panel localisation" width="800"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 430 Pixel Width: 1,200 -->
</center></p>
<h4><a name="3.2"></a> Creating Localized WinForms</h4>
<p>I created a folder called <code>Forms</code> and then placed all of my WinForms under this folder.
After my forms were created, I then manually created two new <code>.resx</code> files, for example, <code>MyForm.en-US.resx</code> and <code>MyForm.fr-FR.resx</code>.
These files were placed in the Forms folder along with my main WinForm.</p>
<p>In my Winform code I did the following in <code>MyForm.cs</code>:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
public sealed class UICultureSwitcher : IDisposable
{
  CultureInfo previous;
  public UICultureSwitcher()
  {
    CultureInfo culture = new CultureInfo(Thread
    .CurrentThread.CurrentCulture.Name);

    previous = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture;
    Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = culture;
   }
   void IDisposable.Dispose()
   {
     Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = previous;
   }
}

public MyForm( Autodesk.Revit.DB.Document doc)
{
    ResourceManager res_mng = new ResourceManager(typeof(MyForm));
    ResourceSet resourceSet = res_mng.GetResourceSet(Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture, true, true);

    InitializeComponent();
    familyDocument = doc;

    label1.Text = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("label1Text");
    label2.Text = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("label2.Text");
    label3.Text = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("label3.Text");
    label4.Text = GetLocalizedTextFromResource("label4.Text");

    // rest of code ...
}
</pre>

<p>Below I have a function that will collect the necessary language information in the .resx file:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
private string GetLocalizedTextFromResource(string key)
{
  try
  {
    // Load the appropriate resource file based on the user's selected language
    ResourceManager resourceManager = new ResourceManager("MyApp.Forms.MyForm", typeof(MyForm).Assembly);
    CultureInfo currentCulture = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture;

    // Fetch the localized text for the given key from the resource
    string localizedText = resourceManager.GetString(key, currentCulture);

    // If the resource for the given key is not found in the culture,
    // explicitly load the default resource (English) using CultureInfo.InvariantCulture
    if (localizedText == null)
    {
      localizedText = resourceManager.GetString(key, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
    }

    // If the resource is still not found, return the key itself as a fallback
    return localizedText ?? key;
  }
  catch (MissingManifestResourceException ex)
  {
    // Handle the exception if the resource file is not found
    // Log the exception
    Console.WriteLine($"Resource file not found. Exception: {ex.Message}");
    return key; // Return the key itself as a fallback
   }
}
</pre>

<p>I then repeat the same methods for my other forms.
Here are screenshots of the end results:</p>
<p><center>

<p style="font-size: 80%; font-style:italic">FamilyType Exporter FR</p>
<p></center></p>
<p>Now, I am updating the datagrid based upon a similar workflow.</p>
<p>I truly hope this helps others.
This has been a very confusing journey.
Everything mentioned was done in Visual Studio 2022 and for Revit 2022-2024:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="zip/ribbon_resx_rvtlanguages.zip">Source code module RVTLanguages.cs</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Neat!</p>
<p>I believe setting the <em>Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture</em> and <em>Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture</em> is not necessary to make multilanguage work, Revit already starts with the <code>CultureInfo</code> correctly set; the only reason to change it might be to test whether your Form is working in another <code>CurrentUICulture</code> language.
Using your class <code>UICultureSwitcher</code> does the trick.</p>
<p>And why are you using <code>CommandName1</code> and <code>CommandName2</code> to create the second line? Just one single <code>CommandName</code> entry with multiple lines should work, like your <code>CommandDescription</code> that has multiple lines.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> You are correct about the CommandName1 and CommandName2.
I originally created the two strings before I did the multiline commandDescription.
Previously, I had tried the "\r\n" method in the .resx file and it was making it part of a single full string versus giving me two lines of strings.
I changed the .resx files for my Ribbon code and generated the Spanish version.
The single CommandName with a <code>shift</code>+<code>return</code> allows for the multiple lines in the ribbon button:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/ribbon_resx_ribbon_es.png" alt="FamilyType Exporter ES" title="FamilyType Exporter ES" width="600"/></p>
<p style="font-size: 80%; font-style:italic">FamilyType Exporter ES</p>
<p><br/>
</center></p>
<p>As for the language switcher, I have plans for expanding functionality for an upcoming Pro version of the app.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your video and quick response.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Geoff and Luiz for clarifying the confusion and sharing the solution!</p>
