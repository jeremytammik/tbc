- Analytical Model API - Message for Public Roadmap
  New API Analytical Model
  New API to enable direct control of the structural analytical model that allows developers to operate independently the creation and modification of analytical elements, offering simplified implementations that work in abstraction from physical elements.

  It would be nice to remove this filter and replace ids.Any() with ids.Count > 0. This will improve performance as Any creates a new Enumerator
  Regarding performance, code readability and semantic meaning are more important than performance in places where performance does not matter.
  I agree that sometimes code readability is more important, but in this case additional lines or conditions are not added. And here is the difference in speed 1200 times with memory allocation = (

  wow, impressive! thank you for the conclusive benchmark. i'll add a note of that result to the blog, i think.

<h3>New Analytical Model API</h3>
<h4><a name="2"></a> New Analytical Model API</h4>
<p>We have just added a new item to
the <a href="https://trello.com/b/ldRXK9Gw/revit-public-roadmap">Revit Public Roadmap</a> announcing
a new API for analytical modelling in Revit.
This is quite an evolution (if not revolution, as the old one will be deprecated).
Please take a close look at it if you are interested in this area.</p>

<h4><a name="3"></a> Praise for Modeless RevitLookup</h4>
<p>A lot of praise came in on Twitter and LinkedIn for
the new <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2021/10/bridges-regeneration-and-modeless-revitlookup.html">modeless RevitLookup</a>:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Benchmarking Generic Any versus Count</h4>
<p>One interesting little item that came up after
the subsequent <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2021/11/revit-20221-sdk-revitlookup-build-and-install.html#4">RevitLookup cleanup</a> questions the use of the <a href="">generic <code>Any</code> method</a> to check for an empty collection
in <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/issues/113">issue #113 &ndash; error snooping family type from project browser</a>,
where <a href="https://github.com/Nice3point">Roman @Nice3point</a> points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would be nice to remove this filter and replace <code>ids.Any()</code> with <code>ids.Count &gt; 0</code>.
This will improve performance, as <code>Any</code> creates a new <code>Enumerator</code>.
Proof:</p>

<p>I agree that sometimes code readability is more important, but in this case additional lines or conditions are not added.
The difference in speed is 1200 times with memory allocation =(</p>
<p>It takes 27 NANO seconds, and 40 Bytes in instruction that is invoked only once per use case ü§£.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Roman for this little suggestion and benchmark, and much more so for all his other outstanding work recently improving and maintaining RevitLookup!</p>
