  <p>This isn’t intended to be a ‘fix’, but more giving you the opportunity to fix the issue yourself first - it’s not super easy, but it’s also not so difficult to do that you shouldn’t be able to make some headway and get better with Python. Should you give it a shot and still be stuck, post the DYN and a really small sample Revit model and the larger community will likely help out. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p></div>

### ForgeTypeId and Units Revisited

We already discussed quite a few aspects of the Revit 2022 unit handling API and  `ForgeTypeId` usage:

####<a name="2"></a> FixtureUnit ParameterType

David Becroft comes to the rescue again answering 
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on how to [convert `ParameterType.FixtureUnit` to `ForgeTypeId`](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/convert-parametertype-fixtureunit-to-forgetypeid/m-p/10268488)

**Question:** I am trying to port some legacy code to Revit 2022 and I am running into the problem converting some `ParameterType` enum values to a `ForgeTypeId`.

`FixtureUnit` and `Invalid` (the result for `ElementId` parameters) are the most pressing ones.

There does not seem to be anything Fixture or Piping related in the `SpecTypeId` class that may apply.
`PipeDimension` comes closest but is not, I think, the same?
Plus, it also exists separately in the ParameterType enum which makes it unlikely that it got a double meaning in Revit 2022.

According to the release documentation there should be a deprecated method in the Parameter class that can help porting ParameterType enum values to ForgeTypeId objects, but Intellisense does not seem to be aware of the existence of such a method.

**Answer:** These methods are in `SpecUtils`, `GetSpecTypeId(ParameterType)` and `GetParameterType(ForgeTypeId)`.

In place of `ParameterType.FixtureUnit`, you can use `SpecTypeId.Number`.

`ParameterType.Invalid` is equivalent to an empty, default-constructed `ForgeTypeId`, i.e. `new ForgeTypeId()`.

####<a name="3"></a> Revit 2022 Unit Handling API in Dynamo

Konrad Sobon does a great job explaining how to deal with this in Dyname and Python in his discussion
of [handling the Revit 2022 unit changes](https://archi-lab.net/handling-the-revit-2022-unit-changes).

####<a name="4"></a> String Values for Forge Units

The unit handling changes also affected some Forge apps:

<img src="img/forge_type_id_schema_id.jpg" alt="RVT ForgeTypeId in Forge" title="RVT ForgeTypeId in Forge" width="800"/> <!-- 1038 -->
</center>

This was discussed and resolved in the StackOverflow question
on [Autodesk Forge returning odd measurement data](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63992151/autodesk-forge-is-returning-odd-measurement-data)

I ended up implementing
the [method `ListForgeTypeIds` in The Building Coder samples](https://github.com/jeremytammik/the_building_coder_samples/blob/master/BuildingCoder/BuildingCoder/Util.cs#L1306-L1367) to help resolve the issue.

I also shared this in the discussion 
on [DisplayUnitType in Revit 2022](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/displayunittype-in-revit-2022/m-p/10320697).

####<a name="5"></a> Unit Conversion Without Knowing

In a related vein, how can you implement a unit conversion without knowing the internal Revit unit?

This question has been around since the beginnings of The Building Coder and was first addressed in blog post #11
on [units](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2008/09/units.html) in September 2008.

It came up again in
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
on a [unit conversion question](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/unit-conversion-question/m-p/9840917):

Simply set the value that you are analysing to 1.0 manually through the user interface using your current display units.

Then, use RevitLookup to analyse what value `V` actually gets stored.

The ratio between those two values, i.e., `V`/1.0 == `V`, immediately provides the conversion factor from display unit to internal database unit (or v.v.).

####<a name="6"></a> How Will We Live Together?

Moving from Revit to the topic of architecture in general, 
at [La Biennale di Venezia](https://www.labiennale.org),
the [17th International Architecture Exhibition](https://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/2021)
is focussed on the theme of *How will we live together?*

> We need a new spatial contract.
In the context of widening political divides and growing economic inequalities, we call on architects to imagine spaces in which we can generously live together.
