<h3>Copy a Model from a Revit Server</h3>

<p>Yesterday evening we had dinner together with developer partners at 

<a href="http://www.heaven23.se">Heaven 23</a> again, 

the same place we visited 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2010/12/vsta-to-stay-and-updater-to-go.html">
last year</a>,

with its unique reflection-accessible cloud.

<p>Today we are holding a DevLab here in the Autodesk office in Gothenburg in Sweden, providing an opportunity for developers to come visit us with their day-to-day work in progress and current issues.

<p>Meanwhile, here is a question related to the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/revit-server-rest-api.html">
Revit Server and its API</a>:

<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I copy a Revit file out of Revit server 2012 to a network location?
I need something similar to the 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2011/11/revit-server-rest-api.html">
RevitServerViewer sample</a>, 

but instead of just relaying the information of the file I would like to get the actual file definition, assign it to an object in .NET, and use standard I/O operations to copy it to multiple other servers.

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Look at the Application.CopyModel method.

<pre>
  public void CopyModel(
    ModelPath sourceModelPath,
    string destFilePath,
    bool overwrite )
</pre>

<p>It copies an existing model to a new file, which can then be copied elsewhere as needed.

<p>It takes the path of the file and does not require opening the file. 
It accepts the path of the server (or file) based source file and the destination path, besides a Boolean specifying whether you wish to overwrite the destination file or not.

<p>If you have to copy multiple files, you can call this method multiple times specifying different source and destination information for each file. 

<p>This method is a Revit API method, so it does require Revit to be up and running and must be called in a valid Revit API context. 
As you can see in the "Revit Server REST API Reference.pdf" in the Revit Server SDK, the REST API supports copying or moving a specified folder or model to another folder within the Revit Server without starting up Revit, but not copying a model to a network location outside of the server.

<h4>Addendum</h4>

<p>Please note that <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/09/download-from-revit-server-and-hide-a-point-cloud-scan.html#2">downloading from Revit Server requires an <code>RSN.INI</code> entry.</a></p>
