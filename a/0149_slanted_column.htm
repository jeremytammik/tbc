<h3>Creating a Slanted Column</h3>

<!-- 1249302 [How to create a slanted column throught the API] -->

<p>We already discussed the creation of 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/inserting-a-beam.html">
beam</a>

and 

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/inserting-a-column.html">
column instances </a>

in previous posts.
In that post on the beam insertion, we explore setting arbitrary start and end points, but the column is left in its default vertical alignment.
Here is a question specifically targeted at the creation of slanted structural columns handled recently by our DevTech AEC workgroup leader Mikako Harada:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
I cannot find any help to explain how to create a slanted column through the API. 
Please explain the process required, i.e.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which NewFamilyInstance method should I use? 
<li>Will the parameter be automatically set to Slanted, or will I need to force it after creating the object. 
<li>If I need to change an existing vertical column to slanted, how do I do that? 
<li>Can I change the location from a point to a line?
</ul>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The first place to look for information about the various overloads of NewFamilyInstance and related methods in the Revit API is the developer guide included with the Revit SDK:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filename Revit 2010 API Developer Guide.pdf.
<li>Section 10.3.5: Creating FamilyInstance Objects.
<li>Table 28: Options for creating instance with NewFamilyInstance().
<li>Table 29: Options for creating instances with other methods.
</ul>

<p>The developer guide does not explain how to insert a slanted column, however.
For that, you have two options: the easiest way to go is to use the NewFamilyInstance overload taking the four arguments Curve, FamilySymbol, Level, and StructuralType. 
This will allow you to directly create a slanted column. 
It will place a column with a SlantedOrVerticalColumnType equal to CT_EndPoint.</p>

<p>The other approach is explicit, appears more complex, illustrates what is going on behind the scenes, and also demonstrates which parameters and properties need to be modified to create a slanted column:</p>

<p>You can use the same method to create both vertical and slanted columns.
Once the column has been created, you can change its 'Slanted Column Type' property using the built-in parameter SLANTED_COLUMN_TYPE_PARAM. 
You can set it to SlantedOrVerticalColumnType CT_EndPoint, CT_Angle, or CT_Vertical. 
Once you set the column to a slanted type, the location property becomes a curve, which you can use to set its start and end points.
Here is a snippet of sample code to achieve these steps:</p>

<pre class="code">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="green">'' you may want to use your own function </span>

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">Function</span>
</pre>

<p>To modify an existing vertical column, you can modify the 'Slanted Column Type' property and then set the two end points in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Mikako for providing this explanation!</p>

<a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/06/creating-a-slanted-column.html#comment-4732593349">below</a>,
Matthias Schneider points out that the built-in parameter needs to be converted to <code>int</code>:</p>

<p>In Revit 2017 and later versions, this doesn't work any more:

<pre>
  param.Set(SlantedOrVerticalColumnType.CT_EndPoint)
</pre>

<p>Instead, you have to use:</p>

<pre>
  param.Set((int)SlantedOrVerticalColumnType.CT_EndPoint)
</pre>

<p>Many thanks to Matthias this observation!</p>
