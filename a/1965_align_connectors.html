<p>Haluk Uzuner raised and solved the interesting issue of
how to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/align-conectors-in-3d-space/m-p/11412155">align connectors in 3D space</a>,
sharing his C++ implementation:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I want to align two families by their connectors.</p>
<p>Families can be placed in any direction in 3D space.
Any axis of any element is not to parallel to each other and project coordinates.
Graphically, it might look like this:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/align_connectors_1.png" alt="Elements and connectors not aligned" title="Elements and connectors not aligned" width="600"/> &lt;! 1229 x 733 --&gt;
</center></p>
<p>My code is below.
It works when the element is located parallel to project axes, but not in the general situation.</p>
<p>Am I in the wrong path?
Is there a better way to do it?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> To align the connectors, given two elements E and F containing connectors A and B with locations P and Q:</p>
<p>Determine the difference between P and Q, the vector V = Q - P.
If you translate the element E containing A by V, A will lie in exactly the same spot as B.
If you don't want it in the exact same spot, but only vertically or horizontally aligned in some way, you need to adapt some of the coordinates of V accordingly.
The translation can be accomplished using the <a href="https://www.revitapidocs.com/2023/aaddd413-01b0-2878-3f79-a281abb6d364.htm">MoveElement method</a>.
Watch out that other attached elements are not moved as well.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> I added some improved pictures below.
As far as understood, move element moves families/elements only.
So, I find U vector and subtract P from it and find the V vector you mentioned.
In the way you mentioned, it works if two families placed in the same plane and orientation.
In my case, none of axes are parallel.
My problem starts after moving element.
My aim is finding cross product of two Z axes that is perpendicular to both axes.
And rotate it by angle.
I am stuck in creating a rotation axis along Z axis of cross product.
As shown in the picture, cross product BasisX, Y, Z always give unit vectors.</p>

</center></p>
<p>Later:
I finally got it to work.
My problem was understanding the <code>Basis</code> vectors.
My final code is below.
It worked perfectly for me.
I additionally draw rotation axis and rotation arc to visualize rotation.</p>
<p>Besides, I was surprised there are no similar code samples on the Internet.
There are many samples, but they all work on parallel planes.
Revit itself already does the action which I am after.
But apparently, API developers didn't need it.</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Harari: Sapiens</h4>
<p>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuval_Noah_Harari">Yuval Noah Harari</a>.</p>
<p>Judging from
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapiens:_A_Brief_History_of_Humankind#Scholarly_reception">very critical scholarly reception</a> of
the book, I must be naive to enjoy it so much.</p>

though, I guess I am average after all.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Afterword: The Animal that Became a God</h4>
<p>SEVENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO, HOMO sapiens was still an insignificant animal minding its own business in a corner of Africa. In the following millennia it transformed itself into the master of the entire planet and the terror of the ecosystem. Today it stands on the verge of becoming a god, poised to acquire not only eternal youth, but also the divine abilities of creation and destruction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Sapiens regime on earth has so far produced little that we can be proud of. We have mastered our surroundings, increased food production, built cities, established empires and created far-flung trade networks. But did we decrease the amount of suffering in the world? Time and again, massive increases in human power did not necessarily improve the well-being of individual Sapiens, and usually caused immense misery to other animals.</p>
<p>In the last few decades we have at last made some real progress as far as the human condition is concerned, with the reduction of famine, plague and war. Yet the situation of other animals is deteriorating more rapidly than ever before, and the improvement in the lot of humanity is too recent and fragile to be certain of.</p>
<p>Moreover, despite the astonishing things that humans are capable of doing, we remain unsure of our goals and we seem to be as discontented as ever. We have advanced from canoes to galleys to steamships to space shuttles – but nobody knows where we’re going. We are more powerful than ever before, but have very little idea what to do with all that power. Worse still, humans seem to be more irresponsible than ever. Self-made gods with only the laws of physics to keep us company, we are accountable to no one. We are consequently wreaking havoc on our fellow animals and on the surrounding ecosystem, seeking little more than our own comfort and amusement, yet never finding satisfaction.</p>
<p>Is there anything more dangerous than dissatisfied and irresponsible gods who don’t know what they want?</p>
