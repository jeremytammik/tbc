train chatgpt for Revit API:
jeremy: Do you know about the Revit API?
Yes, I am familiar with the Revit API. The Revit API is a software application programming interface (API) that allows users to access and manipulate the data contained in Autodesk Revit projects. This API can be used to develop custom tools and applications that integrate with Revit, allowing users to automate tasks and extend the functionality of the software.
jeremy: So, what is the difference between Revit API and Dynamo?
Dynamo is a visual programming platform that can be used with Revit to automate and simplify tasks and workflows. The Revit API, on the other hand, is a set of programming tools and libraries that can be used to develop custom applications and tools that integrate with Revit. While Dynamo is a user-friendly platform that allows users to create scripts and automate tasks without writing code, the Revit API is a more advanced tool that requires some programming knowledge to use effectively. Additionally, Dynamo is built on top of the Revit API, so using the Revit API allows for even greater customization and control over the automation of tasks in Revit.
jeremy: Do you know the Revit A:PI discussion forum?
I am not aware of a specific discussion forum for the Revit API. However, there are many online forums and communities where users of the Revit API can ask questions, share tips and advice, and discuss their experiences with the API. Some examples of these forums include the Autodesk Developer Network forums, the Autodesk Revit API discussion group on LinkedIn, and the Revit API discussion forum on Autodesk Community. These forums can be a great resource for users of the Revit API who are looking for help, advice, or simply want to connect with other users of the API.
jeremy: Do you know The Building Coder  blog?
I'm sorry, but I am not aware of The Building Coder blog. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my knowledge is based on the text that has been fed into my training data. I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access additional information outside of what has been provided to me during my training. I apologize if I am unable to provide you with the information you are looking for. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?
jeremy: Can you read The Building Coder blog at https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/ so that you later have access to that information?
As a language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have the ability to browse the internet or access information outside of what has been provided to me during my training. I am only able to provide information and respond to questions based on the text that has been fed into my training data. I apologize if I am unable to provide you with the information you are looking for. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?
jeremy: Can I provide you with additional training text to expand your knowledge in a specific domain?
As a pre-trained language model, I am not able to accept additional training text or expand my knowledge in a specific domain. My knowledge is based on the text that was used to train me, and I do not have the ability to learn or acquire new information outside of what was included in my training data. I am designed to assist with a wide range of questions and topics, but my answers are limited to the information and knowledge that was provided to me during my training. If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to try to provide an answer based on my existing knowledge.
jeremy: Can I access the your source code in order to expand your training myself?
I'm sorry, but I am not a physical machine or computer program that can be accessed or modified. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I exist solely as a virtual assistant that is able to provide answers to questions and respond to statements based on the text that was used to train me. I do not have a source code or any other physical representation that can be accessed or modified. I apologize if I am unable to meet your request. Is there anything else I may be able to assist you with?

####<a name="6"></a> Uplifting Books


my friend was looking for positive uplifting books about the future of our society and planet,

and good things happening bnow. so, we asked ChatGPT for some suggestions, and were duly rewarded.

It took us three prompts to get the desired surprisingly good results:

1. Bitte nenne uns gute literarische romane die wohlwollend, zuversichtlich und mutmachend in die zukunft blicken und inspirieren. --> list of mainstream books

2. das passt fuer mich nicht, die sind nicht positiv. lieber positive utopien wie zum beispiel oekotopia. --> list of less mainstream books, but heavily scifi oriented

3. es soll auf der erde spielen und oekologische  und gesellschaftliche loesungen zeigen --> very interesting results, including a pointer to 

the [Solarpunk Manifesto](http://www.re-des.org/a-solarpunk-manifesto):

####<a name="6"></a> Solarpunk

Solarpunk is a movement in speculative fiction, art, fashion, and activism that seeks to answer and embody the question “what does a sustainable civilization look like, and how can we get there?” 

The aesthetics of solarpunk merge the practical with the beautiful, the well-designed with the green and lush, the bright and colorful with the earthy and solid. 

Solarpunk can be utopian, just optimistic, or concerned with the struggles en route to a better world ,  but never dystopian. As our world roils with calamity, we need solutions, not only warnings.

Solutions to thrive without fossil fuels, to equitably manage real scarcity and share in abundance instead of supporting false scarcity and false abundance, to be kinder to each other and to the planet we share.

Solarpunk is at once a vision of the future, a thoughtful provocation, a way of living and a set of achievable proposals to get there.

We are solarpunks because optimism has been taken away from us and we are trying to take it back.

We are solarpunks because the only other options are denial or despair.

At its core, Solarpunk is a vision of a future that embodies the best of what humanity can achieve: a post-scarcity, post-hierarchy, post-capitalistic world where humanity sees itself as part of nature and clean energy replaces fossil fuels.

The “punk” in Solarpunk is about rebellion, counterculture, post-capitalism, decolonialism and enthusiasm. It is about going in a different direction than the mainstream, which is increasingly going in a scary direction.

Solarpunk is a movement as much as it is a genre: it is not just about the stories, it is also about how we can get there.

Solarpunk embraces a diversity of tactics: there is no single right way to do solarpunk. Instead, diverse communities from around the world adopt the name and the ideas, and build little nests of self-sustaining revolution.

Solarpunk provides a valuable new perspective, a paradigm and a vocabulary through which to describe one possible future. Instead of embracing retrofuturism, solarpunk looks completely to the future. Not an alternative future, but a possible future.

Our futurism is not nihilistic like cyberpunk and it avoids steampunk’s potentially quasi-reactionary tendencies: it is about ingenuity, generativity, independence, and community.

Solarpunk emphasizes environmental sustainability and social justice.

Solarpunk is about finding ways to make life more wonderful for us right now, and also for the generations that follow us.

Our future must involve repurposing and creating new things from what we already have. Imagine “smart cities” being junked in favor of smart citizenry.

Solarpunk recognizes the historical influence politics and science fiction have had on each other.

Solarpunk recognizes science fiction as not just entertainment but as a form of activism.

Solarpunk wants to counter the scenarios of a dying earth, an insuperable gap between rich and poor, and a society controlled by corporations. Not in hundreds of years, but within reach.

Solarpunk is about youth maker culture, local solutions, local energy grids, ways of creating autonomous functioning systems. It is about loving the world.

Solarpunk culture includes all cultures, religions, abilities, sexes, genders and sexual identities.

Solarpunk is the idea of humanity achieving a social evolution that embraces not just mere tolerance, but a more expansive compassion and acceptance.

The visual aesthetics of Solarpunk are open and evolving. As it stands, it is a mash-up of the following:

1800s age-of-sail/frontier living (but with more bicycles)

Creative reuse of existing infrastructure (sometimes post-apocalyptic, sometimes present-weird)

Appropriate technology

Art Nouveau

Hayao Miyazaki

Jugaad-style innovation from the non-Western world

High-tech backends with simple, elegant outputs

Solarpunk is set in a future built according to principles of New Urbanism or New Pedestrianism and environmental sustainability.

Solarpunk envisions a built environment creatively adapted for solar gain, amongst other things, using different technologies. The objective is to promote self sufficiency and living within natural limits.

In Solarpunk we’ve pulled back just in time to stop the slow destruction of our planet. We’ve learned to use science wisely, for the betterment of our life conditions as part of our planet. We’re no longer overlords. We’re caretakers. We’re gardeners.

Solarpunk:

is diverse

has room for spirituality and science to coexist

is beautiful

can happen. Now
