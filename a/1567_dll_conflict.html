A recurring question just came up again, on handling conflicts between DLLs loaded by Revit add-ins. For instance, this can be caused by a scenario in which add-ins A and B both make use of library DLL C, but specify different versions. A soon as the first add-in has loaded its version of C, the second add-in is prevented from loading the version it requires and cannot run...

<h3>Handling Third Party Library DLL Conflicts</h3>
<p>A recurring question just came up again, on handling conflicts between DLLs loaded by Revit add-ins.</p>
<p>For instance, this can be caused by a scenario in which add-ins A and B both make use of library DLL C, but specify different versions. A soon as the first add-in has loaded its version of C, the second add-in is prevented from loading the version it requires and cannot run.</p>
<p>I have no official solution to suggest for this, just these discussion threads and articles suggesting various workarounds:</p>

<h4>Addendum &ndash; Updated ILMerge Link</h4>
<p>As noted by Micah Gray in
his <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/06/handling-third-party-library-dll-conflicts.html#comment-4983002843">comment below</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ILMerge link above no longer works.
It appears to have moved over to
the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/ILMerge">GitHub ILMerge repository</a>.</p>
