### Revit Roadmap, API and DA4R Survey

A quick post to highlight the opportunities to provide feedback on the Revit product, the Revit API and the Forge Design Automation API for Revit:

Thank you in advance for your time and interest!  

####<a name="4"></a> MacOS Big Sur Upgrade

Not related to Revit or its API, company policy forced me to upgrade to Big Sur MacOS 11.5.2.

The upgrade went smoothly.

However, a few things caused problems for me personally after the successful upgrade.
Luckily, other people have faced and solved the same issues in the months since the initial Big Sur release &ndash;
so, it was a good thing I was able to wait a while before diving into it:

- [Unable to mount my `/a`, `/j`, `/m` and `/p` folders in the root dir](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-mount-the-root-system-file-system-as-writable-in-Big-Sur-MacOS-Big-Sur-Apple)
- [Komodo editor stopped running](https://community.komodoide.com/t/komodo-and-big-sur-do-not-upgrade/5191/15)
- [The VeraCrypt encryption tool failed](https://techstuffer.com/veracrypt-macos-bigsur-compatibility/)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60469031/create-directory-dotenv-on-macos-read-only-file-system

disable the read-only file system in Catalina by following these steps

Boot you mac system into recovery mode. (by bootup system with holding CMD+R).

Open terminal (Present in "Utilities" in the top left menu).

run command

csrutil disable
Restart your system, Bootup normally and check the status: csrutil status.

Before doing any activity open terminal and run command.

sudo mount -uw /
Once this all done you can do write in root location

https://www.quora.com/Can-you-mount-the-root-system-file-system-as-writable-in-Big-Sur-MacOS-Big-Sur-Apple?share=1

Can you mount the root (system) file system as writable in Big Sur (MacOS, Big Sur, Apple)?

Answer:

- Disable FileVault
- Reboot into recovery mode and run: csrutil authenticated-root disable
- Reboot back into macOS
- Find your root mount's device - run mount and chop off the lasts, e.g. if your root is /dev/disk1s2s3, you'll mount /dev/disk1s2
- Create a new directory, for example, ~/mount mkdir -p -m777 ~/mount
- Run sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs DISK_PATH MOUNT_PATH, using the values from above
sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/disk1s2 ~/mount
- Modify the files under the mounted directory
- Run sudo bless --folder MOUNT_PATH/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot
- Reboot your system, and the changes will take place

- tc stopped working
  Error: the OSXFUSE file system is not available (2)
  https://github.com/osxfuse/osxfuse/issues/324
  /var/log/system.log
  $ sudo kextutil /Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Extensions/10.12/osxfuse.kext

- after osx update, i had to rerun this
  $ sudo kextutil /Library/Filesystems/osxfuse.fs/Contents/Extensions/10.15/osxfuse.kext

-->

Mainly for my personal future reference, here are the steps I ended up taking to mount my shortcut folders in the root directory:

<pre>
mount --&gt; /dev/disk1s5s1 on / (apfs, sealed, local, read-only, journaled)
mkdir -p -m777 ~/mount
sudo mount -o nobrowse -t apfs /dev/disk1s5 ~/mount
cd ~/mount/
sudo ln -s /Users/jta/a
sudo ln -s /Users/jta/j
sudo ln -s /Users/jta/music m
sudo ln -s /Users/jta/Pictures p
sudo ln -s /Volumes v
sudo bless --folder ~/mount/System/Library/CoreServices --bootefi --create-snapshot
</pre>


####<a name="5"></a> The Economist on Ransomware and Cybersecurity

Still in the realm of computers and technology, but not Revit API related either, 
*The Economist* published a nice overview
explaining how [ransomware highlights the challenges and subtleties of cybersecurity](https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/06/19/ransomware-highlights-the-challenges-and-subtleties-of-cybersecurity) and
how governments want to defend themselves &ndash; and attack others.
