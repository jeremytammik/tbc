  I would not endorse any of this procedural conversion.  It could change at any time.    In this particular example, it is likely this Element's id changed as a result of synchonization activities in a workshared models.  Newly created elements' ids are not fixed until they have been synchronized for the first time, as elements created by others may end up with the next id in sequence.

### Revit Database Explorer


####<a name="2"></a> Immutable UniqueId, Mutable Element Id 

**Question:** Can I safely assume the integer value of the last part of an `Element` `UniqueId` interpeted as a hexadecimal value always equals its `ElementId` integer value?

This was suggested by the article
on [UniqueId, DWF and IFC GUID](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/uniqueid-dwf-and-ifc-guid.html).

I have a situation where this is not the case:

UniqueId: e41507ae-ace2-4c44-8d8a-072f18908bea-0004d4c5
Integer value of 0004d4c5: 316613
ElementId: 316614
Expected last hex string of the UniqueId : 0004D4C6

Here are the element data displayed by RevitLookup:

unique_id_element_id_mismatch.png 848 720

Here is the hexadecimal conversion of the element id integer value:

unique_id_element_id_mismatch_hex.png 527 422

Reproducible code snippet:

<pre class="code">
static void Print( string s ) 
{
   Console.WriteLine( s );
}

static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
   var a = "e41507ae-ace2-4c44-8d8a-072f18908bea-0004d4c5";
   Print( "Revit UniqueId: " + a );

   Guid episodeId = new Guid( a.Substring( 0, 36 ) );

   int elementId = int.Parse( a.Substring( 37 ),
     NumberStyles.AllowHexSpecifier );

   Print( " EpisodeId: " + episodeId.ToString() );
   Print( string.Format( " ElementId: {0} = {1}",
     elementId.ToString(), elementId.ToString( "x8" ) ) );

   int last_32_bits = int.Parse( a.Substring( 28, 8 ),
     NumberStyles.AllowHexSpecifier );

   int xor = last_32_bits ^ elementId;

   a = a.Substring( 0, 28 ) + xor.ToString( "x8" );

   Print( " Guid: " + a + "\n" );
}
</pre>

**Answer:** I would not endorse any of this procedural conversion.
It could change at any time.
In this particular example, it is likely that this element's id changed as a result of synchonization activities in a workshared models.
Newly created elements' ids are not fixed until they have been synchronized for the first time, as elements created by others may end up with the next id in sequence.

**Response:** Yes, the RVT model is a workshared one.
It makes sense now.
I will not use this UinqueId-ElementId conversion that might change at any time.

Many thanks to Scott Conover for clarifying this behaviour.

the [Revit database explorer (RDBE) project](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/discussions/141):

Revit database explorer (RDBE)

Let me join the race to build the first fully working WPF version of RevitLookup.
I know that [Nice3point](https://github.com/Nice3point) is working on one,
cf. [Enhancements #124](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/discussions/124),
and that [chuongmep](https://github.com/chuongmep) is working
on [RevitLookupWpf](https://github.com/weianweigan/RevitLookupWpf).
I started last, two weeks ago, and mine is almost ready ðŸ˜Š; there are still a few things to correct, but it is already usable:

Many thanks to NeVeSpl for this exciting initiative!

Very exciting to see these new project cropping up.
It will be interesting to see how things pan out in the long haul.
Optimally, maybe the three separate projects can converge and exploit synchronicity... good luck and much success to all three!

The interactive command line interface to drive the creation of filtered element collectors might fit in very nicely into a more complete interactive shell, like the initiative of @chuongmep
to [reinvigorate RevitPythonShell and hook it up with RevitLookup](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/mep-api-intro-and-revitpythonshell-lookup-nuptials.html#3)

Nice3point adds: Sounds interesting; my team and I will update the interface as soon as we have time, there will also be a search, OTA update and new context menu elements. Here it is important to understand that what is needed is not WPF / WinForms, but the possibility to extend the functionality. Itâ€™s more difficult to do this on Forms, where the logic is mixed with the UI, which is bad.
