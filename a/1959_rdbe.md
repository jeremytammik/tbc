  I would not endorse any of this procedural conversion.  It could change at any time.    In this particular example, it is likely this Element's id changed as a result of synchonization activities in a workshared models.  Newly created elements' ids are not fixed until they have been synchronized for the first time, as elements created by others may end up with the next id in sequence.

[NeVeSpl](https://github.com/NeVeSpl) initiated a new RevitLookup discussion #141 presenting
the [Revit database explorer (RDBE) project](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/discussions/141):

> Let me join the race to build the first fully working WPF version of RevitLookup.
I know that Nice3point is working on one #124 here and that chuongmep is working on RevitLookupWpf. I started as the last one (two weeks ago), but mine is almost ready ðŸ˜Š, there are still a few things to correct, but it is already usable:

Revit database explorer (RDBE)

Let me join the race to build the first fully working WPF version of RevitLookup.
I know that [Nice3point](https://github.com/Nice3point) is working on one,
cf. [Enhancements #124](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/discussions/124),
and that [chuongmep](https://github.com/chuongmep) is working
on [RevitLookupWpf](https://github.com/weianweigan/RevitLookupWpf).
I started last, two weeks ago, and mine is almost ready ðŸ˜Š; there are still a few things to correct, but it is already usable:

Many thanks to NeVeSpl for this exciting initiative!

Very exciting to see these new project cropping up.
It will be interesting to see how things pan out in the long haul.
Optimally, maybe the three separate projects can converge and exploit synchronicity... good luck and much success to all three!

The interactive command line interface to drive the creation of filtered element collectors might fit in very nicely into a more complete interactive shell, like the initiative of @chuongmep
to [reinvigorate RevitPythonShell and hook it up with RevitLookup](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/mep-api-intro-and-revitpythonshell-lookup-nuptials.html#3)

Nice3point adds: Sounds interesting; my team and I will update the interface as soon as we have time, there will also be a search, OTA update and new context menu elements. Here it is important to understand that what is needed is not WPF / WinForms, but the possibility to extend the functionality. Itâ€™s more difficult to do this on Forms, where the logic is mixed with the UI, which is bad.
