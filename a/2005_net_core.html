  Hey everyone. I manage the monthly Revit Preview Release project that publishes DEV builds to our customers for testing and feedback. I was wondering if there is some documentation on when we might expose some of this .NET work in the main branch for external testing. I have some eager and excited testers asking about it - but I remain intentionally vague about any timeline as I wasn't certain the status.
  Are there any plans in September or October to expose this work for external testers and if so will there be any documentation available to share with them? I know this is a large and complex project that is still being worked on. I'm just trying to get a sense of what may be coming down the road, and how we may want to message that to Preview testers when the time comes. Thanks! (edited)

  we are hoping to have the .NET work in the main branch for the October preview release, but we are behind schedule and aren't sure will hit our target.
  For now, thank you for being vague on the timeline.

autocad and civil3d already published the preview
revit is still working on it
acad is platform
revit has many dependencies (dynamo, inventor) and addons
microsoft is releasing .net code 8 in november
acad migrated to .net core 6
inventor went straight to 7
revit is debating whether to move straight to 7 or 8
acad worked around the problem preventing 6 and are now discussing moving straight to 7 as well
all products are using acad components
revit september preview will not contain anything yet
revit november is not guaranteed
point to autocad one
dynamo also annouced that they are working on it

</ul>
<p>Sol Amour has covered most of what can be said on this topic in his overview of <a href="https://forum.dynamobim.com/t/dynamo-upgrading-to-net-6">Dynamo upgrading to .NET 6</a>.</p>
<p>Madhukar Moogala and Kean Walmsley have already published some information about the situation in AutoCAD and Civil3D:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adndevblog.typepad.com/autocad/2023/08/call-for-action-next-release-of-autocad.html">Call for Action : Next Release of AutoCAD API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.keanw.com/2023/08/the-next-release-of-autocad-and-net.html">The next release of AutoCAD and .NET</a></li>
</ul>
<p>AutoCAD and Civil3D have published preview versions with .NET Core 6 support for developers to explore.
However, it is by no means clear yet which version of .NET Core will be targeted by their next major releases.
Microsoft may release <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-8-preview-7/">.NET Core 8 in November</a>.</p>
<p>So, as you can imagine, we will probably be facing a similar transition in the Revit API as well.
The situation for Revit is complicated by dependencies, addons, and other components and relationships to consider.
The development team is still working out the details.</p>
<p>So, basically, all we can say about this at the moment is that we are working on it and it remains a moving target.</p>
<p>Please keep your eyes peeled for the Revit preview releases.
There is no guarantee yet by when the internal dependencies will have settled enough to include a version of the Revit API supporting .NET Core in a Revit preview release.
It may take until the end of the year.</p>
<p>What can I do right now?</p>
<p>Above all, if you are interested in this topic, please ensure that you have joined the Revit feedback community and have access to the upcoming preview releases for evaluation.
Then, you can also participate in the feedback forum discussions.
Familiarise yourself with the Revit feedback portal now.
Then you will be ready to jump in and actively join the fray as soon as possible.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> Bye-Bye Document Macro?</h4>
<p>In the course of revamping the Revit API, the development team also took a look at the macro environment.
Support for .NET Core will obviously affect that as well.
Last year, they asked for feedback from the add-in developer community
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/research-how-do-you-use-revit-macros/m-p/11158305">how you use Revit macros</a>
and <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/05/analysis-of-macros-journals-and-add-in-manager.html#2">shared back the results</a>.</p>
<p>As a result of this and other usage analysis, the current plan is to drop support for document macros.
Converting a document macro to an application macro is easy, and I hope to share some simple instructions on that anon.</p>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Polygon Area Algorithms</h4>
<p>Moving on from plans and speculations about what the future might bring,
Richard <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1035859">RPThomas108</a> Thomas
shared some valuable hints and examples of polygon area algorithms answering a question on how to obtain
the <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/area-of-a-wall-opening/m-p/12174104">area of a wall opening</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> How can I calculate the area of a wall opening?
I cannot delete any object.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can delete an object temporarily inside a transaction that is never committed, so the changes are never stored in the database:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> I cannot delete elements, even transitory.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Here is a possible solution, except for ruled faces (for ruled faces, there must be a mathematical approximation similar to below):</p>
<p>Generally, for other types of faces you can find the inner loops of the face and use <code>Edge.GetCurveUV</code> to create a loop in the dimensions of the face parameters.
Unfortunately, there is no tessellate for <code>CurveUV</code>, but you can evaluate points along the loop to get a set of ordered UVs.
Each <code>U</code> and <code>V</code> can then be multiplied based on how the face is parameterised in that direction, i.e., for a planar face, it 1 in both directions, but for a cylindrical face the <code>U</code> is based on angles, so, instead you have to multiply it based on radius to get the segment length (<code>V</code> is still in length, so you can use 1 for that).
Prior to the existence of <code>CurveUV</code>, you would likely have had to have used <code>Edge.EvaluateOnFace</code> to create the tessellated points.</p>
<p>Once you've multiplied the UV's, you can create a polygon and use
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">shoelace formula</a> etc. to find the area of the polygon and so the surface area of the opening.</p>
<p>It is hard for faces with normalised parametrisation (such as ruled faces), because the multiple used to convert normalised to raw in one direction changes along the other direction.
For example, if you have a ruled surface between two lines of different length, one at the base (Vmin) and one at the top (Vmax), the length varies from base to top, so how you convert <code>U</code> to raw parameter isn't constant, but varies according to the height of <code>V</code> where <code>U</code> is being measured.</p>
<p>How we measure openings in surfaces can also be a bit subjective to a degree.
If you have a cylindrical wall, then the area for the same opening on the outer face will be larger than the inner, but neither, I suspect, will likely be the thing that is useful to an MEP engineer.
I assume they would likely want the projected (flat opening area).
For this, you would probably have to take the worst case (inner area) and project it onto a plane to establish what can fit into that 2D area (or how much ventilation you have).</p>
<p>Another method I used in the past for 2D is to tesselate the perimeter and fill the opening with a grid of points, then
use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation">Delaunay triangulation</a> etc., adding up the sum area of resulting triangles.
The area is always slightly underestimated for concave edges and slightly overestimated for convex edges.
Smaller triangles obviously improves that, but increases processing time.</p>
<p>Another option is to create a single faced solid over the opening with one of the shape builders.
Some surface types are not supported by all shape builders, however.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/area_of_wall_opening_1.png" alt="Area of wall opening" title="Area of wall opening" width="800"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 450 Pixel Width: 1,087 -->
</center></p>
<p>You can then extract the surface area of those.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/area_of_wall_opening_2.png" alt="Area of wall opening" title="Area of wall opening" width="800"/> <!-- Pixel Height: 439 Pixel Width: 1,082 -->
</center></p>
<p>I think walls are quite simple compared to floors.
In shaped floors, especially, you don't always get inner loops.
For example in the below there are no inner loops.
The thing you do know however is that the actual outline edges always have vertical faces adjacent.
Therefore, fold edges always contain two horizontal or quasi-horizontal faces.
So, by elimination of those that way, you are left with the outline edge curves and it is then just a case of ordering them into loops and determining if they are outer or inner.
You can't rely on direction of curve for that because in reality they are all outer edges to their face.</p>

<p>So, there isn't a universal solution to these things.</p>

<h4><a name="8"></a> Compress Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h4>
<p>Please compress stuff!</p>
<p>It is worthwhile paying attention to the carbon footprint of today's widespread and growing usage of the Internet and digital devices.</p>
<p>Some estimates deem it comparable with the pollution generated by airlines and flying.</p>
<p>I just checked out the effect of reduction of resolution and compression (using <a href="https://compressjpeg.com/">compressjpeg.com</a>) on an image that I emailed to some friends:</p>
<ul>
<li>a0.jpg &ndash; 3506 pixel height original &ndash; 1.759.026 bytes</li>
<li>a1.jpg &ndash; 3506 pixel height compressed &ndash; 850.770 bytes</li>
<li>a2.jpg &ndash; 900 pixel height  &ndash; 149.291 bytes</li>
<li>a3.jpg &ndash; 900 pixel height compressed &ndash; 97.220 bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>The shrunk and compressed image was virtually indistinguishable from the original &ndash; it was even a bit easier to read due to slightly higher contrast.</p>
<p>The combination of lower pixel count and compression reduced the size from over 1.7 MB to less than 100 kB, by a factor of over 18.</p>
<p>Some supporting articles that I checked out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia entry on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas">Greenhouse gas</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector">Greenhouse emissions by sector</a></li>
