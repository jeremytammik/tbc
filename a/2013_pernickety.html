Many thanks to George for publishing his first Revit API blog post.
It is perfect in every way.
And yet, it also provides an opportunity for me to share one slightly crazy aspect of my personality: exaggerated perfectionism.
George's post looks like this, and is perfectly OK as it is.

How to Use ToElements Method Correctly

There have been a couple of questions regarding the usage of the `ToElements` method while filtering elements using the `FilteredElementCollector` class.
The `ToElements` method in the `FilteredElementCollector` class returns the complete set of elements that meet the specified filter criteria as a generic `IList`.

However, it's also worth noting that some members of the Revit API community tend to use the ToElemets method after using the FilteredElementCollector which in turn increases memory usage and slows down the performance of the same.

One reason for using ToElements is to obtain the element count. However, that can also be achieved by calling GetElementCount.

Another more valid reason is to access the elements in the list by index, e.g., you have 1000 elements in the list and you want to read their data in a specific order, e.g., #999, #1, #998, #2 or whatever. Then, you need the index provided by the list, and cannot just iterate over them on the predefined order provided by the enumerator.

Here are examples that demonstrates the usage of the two:

Example 1, using FilteredElementCollector alone to iterate over all Wall elements:

```
  IEnumerable walls
    = new FilteredElementCollector(doc)
      .OfClass(typeof(Wall));

  foreach (Element item in walls)
  {
    ElementId id = item.Id;
  }
```

Example 2, using both FilteredElementCollector and ToElements to iterate over all Wall elements:

```
  IList wallList = new FilteredElementCollector(doc)
    .OfClass(typeof(Wall))
      .ToElements();

  foreach (Element item in wallList)
  {
    ElementId id = item.Id;
  }
```

in [how to distinguish redundant rooms](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/how-to-distinguish-redundant-rooms.html).

For the C# code colourisation, I used to use Visual Studio and its tools:

Lately, I have switched to instead.

However, this tool is no longer bein maintained, so it may be time to switch to yet another solution...

Sorry to you all, George, my colleagues and readers, and all the rest of the universe for being pernickety, but that seems to be my naturure, so best accept it and let it be...

Does it bring any advantages? Are they worth the effort? Up to each and every person to decide for herself, I would say...


- the main screw is 180 mm x 7.3 mm. they would have used 190mm but didn't have any.

<h3>Pernickety Blogging</h3>
<p>I am still in hospital, and my broken hip has been fixed.
The main screw is 7.3 mm x 180 mm.
They would have preferred to use 190 mm length but didn't have any available.
I have big bones.</p>
<p>My friend Madlee has a nice email footer in the smartphone, saying:</p>

<p>My colleague George published his first Revit-API-related blog post,
<a href="https://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2023/10/how-to-use-toelements-method-correctly.html">How to use ToElements Method correctly</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations on that, George, and many thanks for your work and contributions!</p>
<p>I checked it in advance and gave it my OK.
In spite of that, it makes a total difference to me actually seeing it "in print", in its final published version.
The difference and effect it has on my perception is tremendous, astounding, and I use it for my own blog posts as well, correcting, previewing and making a huge number of minute corrections and improvements (?) in the final stages of publication, just before hitting the ultimate pblish button.</p>
<p>In this case, I was astoubnded by the number and irrelevance of the little improvement possibilities that struck my eye.</p>
