- compare element
  Chuong Ho
  It's been a while since our last Revit Add-in manager update, but we've got some exciting news to share today!
  I thrilled to introduce a new tool that's now part of the Add-in manager. This tool is a game-changer for both developers and users as it allows you to easily compare differences between two elements. Not only that, but it also uses color to visually highlight all parameter variations, making it incredibly intuitive and user-friendly. Plus, you can view the similarity results of value comparisons between parameters from those two elements
  Stay tuned for more updates and get ready to experience a whole new level of efficiency with our latest addition to the Revit Add-in manager!"

  Yet another [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup) like tool. RevitLookup was an indispensable tool to work with Revit API for many years. But now, there is a better tool for the job. Let me introduce you to RDBE and its capabilities. RDBE not only allows us to explore database in a more efficient way thanks to querying, but also to modify Revit database through ad hoc scripts written in C#.

Chuong Ho announces new functionality enabling highlighting and comparison of differences between Revit database elements in his alternative Revit Add-in Manager:

This tool is a game-changer for both developers and users as it allows you to easily compare differences between two elements.

####<a name="3"></a> The Revit Database Explorer RDBE

We already [mentioned](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2022/07/immutable-uniqueid-and-revit-database-explorer.html#3)
the [Revit database explorer RDBE](https://github.com/NeVeSpl/RevitDBExplorer) last year:

> The fastest, most advanced, asynchronous Revit database exploration tool for Revit 2021+.
Yet another [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup)-like tool.
RevitLookup was indispensable to work with Revit API for many years.
Now, there is a better tool for the job.
Let me introduce RDBE and its capabilities.
RDBE not only allows us to explore database in a more efficient way thanks to querying, but also to modify Revit database through ad-hoc scripts written in C#.

It has undergone further enhancement since then.

[NeVeS](https://github.com/NeVeSpl) points out that you can use this alternative Revit database exploration tool for better access to Extensible Storage Schemata, cf. RDBE's extensive list of features:

- [Query Revit database](#query-revit-database-with-rdq-revit-database-querying)
- [Script Revit database](#script-revit-database-with-rds-revit-database-scripting)
- [Ad-hoc `SELECT` query](#ad-hoc-select-query)
- [Ad-hoc `UPDATE` command](#ad-hoc-update-command)
- [Filterable tree of elements and list of properties and methods](#filterable-tree-of-elements-and-list-of-properties-and-methods)
- [Easy access to Revit API documentation](#easy-access-to-revit-api-documentation)

####<a name="4"></a> The Shapely Python 2D Geometry Library

Jake of [Ripcord Engineering](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/3926242) recently
shared a bunch of valuable [Python and gbXML tips](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/07/export-gbxml-and-python-tips.html).
Discussing a solution
to [gbXML from adjacent conceptual mass or space missing small surface](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/gbxml-from-adjacent-conceptual-mass-adjacent-space-missing-small/m-p/12238726),
he now added a pointer
to [Shapely](https://pypi.org/project/shapely/),
a powerful-looking Python 2D geometry library for manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the Cartesian plane.
For instance, it includes support for 2D Booleans
and [set operations](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/set_operations.html).
In this context, the Python [xgbxml library](https://pypi.org/project/xgbxml/) looks
like another very handy tool.
