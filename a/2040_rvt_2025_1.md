####<a name="2.4"></a> Revit 2025.1 SDK

The Revit SDK was also updated.
The updated version is available from
the [APS Revit developer page](https://aps.autodesk.com/developer/overview/revit).
One small change in the documentation right up front says:

> Major changes and renovations to the Revit 2025.1 API

> API additions

> AspNetCore

> Revit now has a framework reference to Microsoft.AspNetCore.App, so that addins can use AspNetCore.

Furthermore, note the API-related issues listed above, some of them not under the API heading:

- Updated the Revit SDK MacroSample to .NET 8
- Fixed an API issue where GetAllInstalledRevitProducts does not properly return the correct Revit 2025 version
- Fixed an issue which prevented ASP.Net Core from being used in Revit addins
- Fixed issue that could occur when the Windows region was set to Thai/Thailand
- Fixed an API issue where PartUtils.FindMergeableClusters would return invalid clusters,
  cf. the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160) thread
  reporting that [PartUtils.FindMergeableClusters finds clusters which are not valid for merge](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/partutils-findmergeableclusters-finds-clusters-which-are-not/m-p/12402263)

####<a name="3"></a> Placing Detail Group Without UI Access

Luiz Henrique [@ricaun](https://ricaun.com/) Cassettari provided a nice workaround to
enable [placing detail group in legend view without access to UI, e.g., for Design Automation](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/placing-detail-group-in-legend-view-without-access-to-ui-design/m-p/12795399):

**Question:** I would like to *place a detail group in legend view without access to UI  for Design Automation*:
in Design Automation for Revit, I want to place detail groups onto a legend view. The approach would typically be:

- [change active view](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2017/b6adb74b-39af-9213-c37b-f54db76b75a3.htm)
- [call PlaceGroup()](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2019/586d4f2e-0985-2d0b-dbb7-ea6d2f704336.htm)

However, in Design Automation, I don't have access to the UI and therefore cannot set `UIDocument.Activeview`.
Is there an alternative method for placing detail groups which takes in a `View` as an argument?
Or are there ways to change the `ActiveView` in Design Automation?

Ricaun provided non-UI-dependent code that places both model and detail groups.
It just lacks the possibility to control the target view.

However, this can be worked around by letting Revit place the detail group in any old view,
then copy and paste to the desired target view and delete the intermediate element.

Here is a 30-minute video testing [placement of a detail group in both Revit on the Windows desktop and Revit for Design Automation](https://youtu.be/oSCvXGx4SaM):

</center>

Going even further, ricaun
implemented [`RevitTestPlaceGroup.Tests`, a unit test project for the PlaceGroup problem](https://github.com/ricaun-io/RevitTestPlaceGroup.Tests) and
shows it running in another 36-minute video
on [creating `PlaceGroupDetail` unit test for Revit API](https://youtu.be/VhaFv_UaHGU):

Ever so many thanks to ricaun for the very helpful work and excellent documentation!
