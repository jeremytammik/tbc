  I am excited to announce a significant development in data interaction and retrieval processes using Autodesk Platform Services from Autodesk. Today, I am officially releasing the first version of a toolkit designed to facilitate data access, aiming to support AI processes, Data Analysts, LLM, and explore the boundaries where APS may fall short in providing for end-users.
  This toolkit is open-source, ensuring accessibility to all engineers, BIM developers, and data scientists. I am actively working on refining it further. Please feel free to provide any feedback in the comments below this post, and I will consider all suggestions.

### API Context, APS Toolkit and DA4R Debugging

####<a name="2"></a> Determining Revit API Context

Luiz Henrique [@ricaun](https://ricaun.com/) Cassettari finally cracked the
question [how to know if Revit API is in context](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/how-to-know-if-revit-api-is-in-context/td-p/12574320):

> Revit API throws exceptions if your code is trying to execute Revit API methods in a modeless context, e.g., a WPF modeless view; that's the reason you need to use `ExternalEvent` to execute Revit API code in context.

> Sometimes you need to know whether code is running in context or if not, to just execute the Revit API code right away or send it to ExternalEvent to be executed.

> If you have access to `UIApplication` or `UIControllerApplication`, and if you try to subscribe to an event outside Revit API context, you are gonna have this exception: Invalid call to Revit API! Revit is currently not within an API context.

> Meaning: you can use that to know if your code is in context or not.

> I'm using this technique using my open source library to manage the creation of an external event if it is not in context and enable it to run Revit API asynchronously in [ricaun.Revit.UI.Tasks](https://github.com/ricaun-io/ricaun.Revit.UI.Tasks).

Many thanks to ricaun for sharing this long-sought-after solution!

####<a name="3"></a> Detect Revit User Input State

In a related vein, we also discussed the question
of [detecting Revit user input state in real-time via Revit API](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/detecting-revit-user-input-state-in-real-time-via-revit-api/td-p/12610444).

####<a name="4"></a> Easy Revit API

Big welcome to a new member in the Revit programming blogosphere,
[Easy Revit API](https://easyrevitapi.com/).
Welcome, Mohamed-Youssef.
Best of luck and much success with your blog and other projects!

####<a name="5"></a> APS Toolkit

In the last post,
I mentioned [Chuong Ho](https://chuongmep.com/)'s
[BIM interactive notebooks](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2024/02/interactive-bim-notebook-temporary-graphics-and-ai.html#2).

Now you can see how he put them to use in his newest project,
the [APS Toolkit](https://github.com/chuongmep/aps-toolkit):

> I am excited to announce a significant development in data interaction and retrieval processes using Autodesk Platform Services from Autodesk. Today, I am officially releasing the first version of a toolkit designed to facilitate data access, aiming to support AI processes, Data Analysts, LLM, and explore the boundaries where APS may fall short in providing for end-users.
This toolkit is open source, ensuring accessibility to all engineers, BIM developers, and data scientists. I am actively working on refining it further. Please feel free to provide any feedback in the comments below this post, and I will consider all suggestions.

[APS Toolkit](https://github.com/chuongmep/aps-toolkit) empowers you to explore the Autodesk Platform Services APS.
It's built on top of [Autodesk.Forge](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Forge/)
and [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/).
The toolkit includes features enabling you to read, download and write data from APS and export to CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, etc.

Features:

- Read/Download SVF Model
- Read/Query Properties Database SQLite
- Read/Download Properties Without Viewer
- Read Geometry Data
- Read Metadata
- Read Fragments
- Read MeshPacks
- Read Images
- Export Data to CSV
- Export Data to Excel
- Export Data to Parquet

Sample usage to export Revit Data To Excel using .NET C&#35;:

<pre><code class="language-csharp">using APSToolkit;
using Autodesk.Forge;
using APSToolkit.Database;
using APSToolkit.Auth;
var token = Authentication.Get2LeggedToken().Result;
string urn = "dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5maWxlOnZmLk9kOHR4RGJLU1NlbFRvVmcxb2MxVkE_dmVyc2lvbj0z";
var RevitPropDbReader = new PropDbReaderRevit(urn, token);
RevitPropDbReader.ExportAllDataToExcel("result.xlsx");
</code></pre>

Sample usage to export Revit Data To Excel using Python:

<pre><code class="language-python">from aps_toolkit import Auth
from aps_toolkit import PropDbReaderRevit
auth = Auth()
token = auth.auth2leg()
urn = "dXJuOmFkc2sud2lwcHJvZDpmcy5maWxlOnZmLk9kOHR4RGJLU1NlbFRvVmcxb2MxVkE_dmVyc2lvbj0z"
prop_reader = PropDbReaderRevit(urn, token)
df = prop_reader.get_data_by_category("Ducts")
df.save_to_excel("result.xlsx")
</code></pre>

Many thanks to Chuong Ho for creating and sharing this powerful toolkit!

####<a name="6"></a> Gemini with Image and Video Input

An impressive example of use of LLM with video input support is presented stating
that [the killer app of Gemini Pro 1.5 is video](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/21/gemini-pro-video.

####<a name="8"></a> Generative AI transformer

A nice beginner's guide to understanding LLM explains
why [generative AI exists because of the transformer](https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/).

####<a name="9"></a> Design to Reduce Junk Data

We are generating huge and ever-growing amounts of data, much of which is useless and never looked at again, so it is well worth
pondering &ndash; and avoiding &mdash; [design patterns that encourage junk data](https://css-irl.info/design-patterns-that-encourage-junk-data/).

####<a name="10"></a> C and C++ are Risky

70 percent of all security vulnerabilities are caused by memory safety issues, and many of those are automatically eliminated by working in a memory-safe programming language.
Therefore,
