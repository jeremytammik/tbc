####<a name="3"></a> Calling Revit Command from Chromium Browser

last week, Andrej Licanin of [Bimexperts](https://bimexperts.com/sr/home) shared
a nice solution demonstrating [how to use the Revit built-in CefSharp browser in WPF](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2023/11/camera-target-and-toposolid-subdivision-material.html#2).

This week he expanded on that in his contribution
on [calling Revit command from Chromium browser](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/calling-revit-command-from-chromium-browser/td-p/12413281):

This is another guide on Chromium browser using CefSharp, a continuation
of the [simple WPF with a Chromium browser guide](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/simple-wpf-with-a-chromium-browser-guide/td-p/12396552).
Hope someone finds it useful.

Basically, what I wanted was for a button in the browser (on a webpage) to trigger a command in Revit.
This works by "binding" a javascript method to a c# object and its method.
In the Javascript we `await` for the object and call its function.

So, let's make a dummy object for binding and a method in it.
In order to call a Revit method it will need a reference to an external event handler and its event:

<pre class="prettyprint">
   public class BoundObject
   {
     public int Add(int a, int b)
     {
       ExtApp.handler.a = a;
       ExtApp.handler.b = b;
       ExtApp.testEvent.Raise();

       return a+b;
     }
   }
</pre>

The event and its handler are saved in the External app as `static` for ease of access.

<pre class="prettyprint">
  internal class ExtApp : IExternalApplication
  {
    public static IExternalApplication MyApp;
    public static ChromiumWebBrowser browser;
    public static ExternalEvent testEvent;
    public static MyEvent handler;
    public Result OnShutdown(UIControlledApplication application)
    {
      // Cef.Shutdown();
      return Result.Succeeded;
    }

    public Result OnStartup(UIControlledApplication application)
    {
      MyApp = this;
      //code for making a button

      handler = new MyEvent();
      testEvent= ExternalEvent.Create(handler);

      return Result.Succeeded;
    }
  }
</pre>

In the WPF control, the browser is embedded like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  &lt;Window x:Class="RevitTestProject.TestWindow"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:RevitTestProject"
    xmlns:cef="clr-namespace:CefSharp.Wpf;assembly=CefSharp.Wpf"
    mc:Ignorable="d"
    Width="1000" Height="500"&gt;
    &lt;Grid Background="PapayaWhip"&gt;
      &lt;cef:ChromiumWebBrowser Name="ChromiumBrowser" Address="http://www.google.com" Width="900" Height="450"  /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
  &lt;/Window&gt;
</pre>

Here is the code behind the window:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    public TestWindow()
    {
      InitializeComponent();
      ChromiumBrowser.Address = "https://www.google.com";
      ChromiumBrowser.Address = "C:\\Users\\XXX\\Desktop\\index.html";
      BoundObject bo = new BoundObject();
      ChromiumBrowser.JavascriptObjectRepository.Register("boundAsync", bo, true, BindingOptions.DefaultBinder);
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
      this.Dispose();
    }
</pre>

So, to use it, make an `index.html` and submit the path to it in the browser address.

The Test webpage look like this:

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Bridge Test&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    async function callCSharpAction() {
      await CefSharp.BindObjectAsync("boundAsync");
      boundAsync.add(16, 2);
    }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;button id="action1" onclick="callCSharpAction()"&gt;Action 1&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button id="action2" onclick="alert('Button is working')"&gt;Action 2&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button id="action3"&gt;Action 3&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

The handler code:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  internal class MyEvent : IExternalEventHandler
  {
    public int a;
    public int b;
    public void Execute(UIApplication app)
    {
      TaskDialog.Show( "yoyoy",
        "data is " + a.ToString()
        + " and " + b.ToString() + ".");
    }

    public string GetName()
    {
      return "YOYOOY";
    }
  }
</pre>

####<a name="4"></a> Chromium Browser Js Round Trip Callback

To make a callback from c# function to the browser, you just need an instance of the browser, and a function in the javascript code that will be called.

here is an edited index.html

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Bridge Test&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;script src="script.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    async function callCSharpAction() {
      await CefSharp.BindObjectAsync("boundAsync");
      boundAsync.add(16, 2);
    }

    function showAlert(arg1) {
      // Your JavaScript logic here
      alert("Function called with arguments: " + arg1);
      return;
    }
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;button id="action1" onclick="callCSharpAction()"&gt;Action 1&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button id="action2" onclick="alert('Button is working')"&gt;Action 2&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;button id="action3"&gt;Action 3&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

and in our bound class we save a instance to the browser so we can use it on command

<pre class="prettyprint">
  public class BoundObject
  {
    public int aS;
    public int bS;
    internal ChromiumWebBrowser browser;

    public void CallCSharpMethod()
    {
      MessageBox.Show("C# method called!");
      // Add more code here as needed
    }
    public int Add(int a, int b)
    {
      ExtApp.handler.a = a;
      ExtApp.handler.b = b;
      ExtApp.testEvent.Raise();

      return a+b;
    }

    public int SendSomeDataFromLocal(int a)
    {
      browser.ExecuteScriptAsync("showAlert("+a.ToString()+")");
      return a;
    }
  }
</pre>

i passed it when i created the browser in the window codebehind.

<pre class="prettyprint">
  public TestWindow()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    ChromiumBrowser.Address = "https://www.google.com";
    ChromiumBrowser.Address = "C:\\Users\\XXX\\Desktop\\index.html";
    BoundObject bo = new BoundObject();
    //ExtApp.boundObj = bo;
    bo.browser = ChromiumBrowser;
    ChromiumBrowser.JavascriptObjectRepository.Register(
      "boundAsync", bo, true, BindingOptions.DefaultBinder);
  }
</pre>

finally you can call it from revit

<pre class="prettyprint">
  public Result Execute(
    ExternalCommandData commandData,
    ref string message,
    ElementSet elements)
  {
    ExtApp.boundObj.SendSomeDataFromLocal(999);
    return Result.Succeeded;
  }
</pre>

this concludes a round trip from the browser and back. I hope anyone reading this finds it useful.


####<a name="5"></a> Determine Element Location

We put together a nice little ovrview on various methods to determine the location of a BIM element discussing
[how can the coordinates for a Revit fabrication part be obtained with the Revit API](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77556660/how-can-the-coordinates-for-a-revit-fabricationpart-be-obtained-with-the-revit-a)?

**Question:** I need to obtain the coordinates for Revit MEP FabricationParts. All of the elements I get do have a location property but not all of them have either a LocationPoint or a LocationCurve. More specific, only for Pipe elements am I able to get XYZ values through the LocationCurve. Elements such as Threadolet, Elbow, Weld and Fishmouth don't have either a LocationPoint or a LocationCurve.

**Answer:** Three options that can be used on almost all BIM elements are:

- Use the `Location` property
- Retrieve the element [`Geometry` property](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/d8a55a5b-2a69-d5ab-3e1f-6cf1ee43c8ec.htm), e.g., calculate the centroid of all the vertices
- Use the element [`BoundingBox` property](https://www.revitapidocs.com/2024/def2f9f2-b23a-bcea-43a3-e6de41b014c8.htm), e.g., calculate its midpoint

However, for these types of `FabricationParts` specifically, [egeer](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15534202/egeer) and [bootsch](https://stackoverflow.com/users/21999391/bootsch) suggest using the element's connector locations instead:

For OLets and ThreadOLets, you can use the connector that connects to the main pipe as its insertion point, since that is technically where the element was inserted:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    Connector insertionPointConnector = OLet.ConnectorManager
        .Connectors
        .OfType&lt;Connector&gt;()
        .FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.ConnectorType == ConnectorType.Curve);

    XYZ insertionPoint = insertionPointConnector?.Origin;
</pre>

Since their connectors are atypical in that they do not connect to another connector, but instead a curve, you need to get the one that is `ConnectorType.Curve`.

For welds, elbows and other inline elements, you can similarly use the connectors and get their origins.
If you want the center of the element, you can use vector math to calculate that using the connector's direction and location.
The direction that the connector points is the `BasisZ` property of the Connector's `CoordinateSystem`.

<pre class="prettyprint">
    XYZ connectorDirection = insertionPointConnector?.CoordinateSystem.BasisZ;
</pre>

The solution I end up with is a bit different from the answer given by egeer above:
I ended up getting a Connector for each element (the ones without a `LocationCurve` or `LocationPoint`).
Here's the code in VB:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    Dim insertionPointConnector As Connector = CType(e, FabricationPart).ConnectorManager.Connectors.OfType(Of Connector).FirstOrDefault()
    Dim elementOrigin as XYZ = Connector.insertionPointConnector.Origin
</pre>

`e` is of type Element.

Many thanks to egeer and bootsch for jumping in with these good solutions!

####<a name="6"></a> Create a Structural-Only 3D View

Harry Mattison continues his AU solution spree presenting a nice code sample demonstrating how
to [create a 3D view showing only Revit wall structural layers](https://boostyourbim.wordpress.com/2023/12/04/create-a-3d-view-showing-only-revit-wall-structural-layers/)
which is discussed in further depth in

on how to [create new View3D that just displays wall layers of "Structure" function](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/create-new-view3d-that-just-displays-wall-layers-of-quot/td-p/12344156).
Harry's sample code performs the following steps:

- Create new 3D isometric view
- Set view parts visibility `PartsVisibility.ShowPartsOnly`
- Create parts from all walls
- For each part, retrieve its built-in parameter `DPART_LAYER_INDEX`
- Convert from string to wall compound structure layer index
- Hide part if its compound structure layer function differs from `MaterialFunctionAssignment.Structure`

Many thanks to Harry for addressing this need!

####<a name="9"></a> Sending Data by Pigeon

Talking about carbon footprint and the cost and efficiency of digital data transmission, there is obviously a point at which transmission of large data can be speeded up by putting it on a storage device and moving that around rather physically than squeezing it through the limited bandwidth of the Internet:
