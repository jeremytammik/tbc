<h4>System Requirements</h4>

<p>Make sure your computer is compatible with WebEx. See the

<a href="http://support.webex.com/support/system-requirements.html">

more information about supported platforms.

If you have never used WebEx, you can test your computer's readiness by joining a

<a href="http://www.webex.com/lp/jointest">
test meeting</a> before

the Hackathon event.</p>

<p>Note: WebEx works with most Web browsers.  However, certain settings and security restrictions can sometimes prevent WebEx from working properly.  If you are having a problem launching WebEx, you may be able to quickly resolve it by using a different Web browser on your computer.</p>

<h4>October Events and Travel in Europe</h4>

<p>So what comes after this weekend?</p>

<p>Assuming we survive both the event and the post-event celebrations...</p>

<p>I recently mentioned the dates for the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/upcoming-event-calendar.html#2">
DevDays 2014</a> toward

the end of the year, and the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/08/upcoming-event-calendar.html#4">
European events</a> coming

up in October in Zurich, Brussels, Darmstadt and Berlin.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I am currently planning on attending all four of these, so that will be a busy and exciting travelling month for me.</p>

<h4>Comparing a Plane and a Face</h4>

<p>Finally, let's discuss a more technical Revit API related question as well...</p>

<p>I recently looked at

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/planes-projections-and-picking-points.html">
planes, projections and picking points</a>.</p>

<p>Here is a simple geometrical question related to that:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the Revit API, if I have a Plane and a Face, how can I check if they are in the same plane?</p>

<p>Would comparing Z values and their normals suffice?</p>


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> If your face is a planar face and the planar face is horizontal, the answer is yes.</p>

<p>In general, a plane in 3D space is uniquely defined by exactly four real numbers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Three for the normal vector</li>
<li>One for the signed distance from the origin</li>
</ul>

<p>If and only if those four are equal, you have the same plane.</p>

<p>For further details, please refer to the recent discussion of the

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/planes-projections-and-picking-points.html#10">
mathematical and Revit plane definitions</a>.</p>
