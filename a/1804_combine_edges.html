  sorting and orienting curves to form a contiguous loop
  One method that does part of the work that you should definitely be aware of is the Edge.AsCurveFollowingFace method that returns a curve corresponding to the edge oriented in its topological direction on the specified face. That is the simplest option and a good place to start.

  I myself haven't done that yet but my colleague did - it works. Now when he switches to the Russian keyboard he can insert a csv to a family with Cyrillic text with no loss.

<h3>Cyrillic Lookup, Moving Grids and Combining Edges</h3>
<p>Let's start this week with the following topics

<p>Back to the Revit API and some useful solutions discussed in 
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a>:</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Cyrillic Characters in Lookup Tables</h4>
<p>There seem to be some issues handling Cyrillic characters in lookup tables, as pointed out in the thread 
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/russian-letters-doesn-t-export-in-lookup-tables/m-p/9116678">Russian letters doesn't export in lookup tables</a>.
Happily, however, at least a partial solution can be found:</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a> Moving a Grid</h4>
<p>Matt Taylor very kindly pointed out the solution to another old thread
on <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/moving-a-grid/m-p/9115841">moving a grid</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would guess that the grid cannot be moved because it doesn't have a leader.
Use the <code>AddLeader</code> method to add a leader first.
You'll also probably need to do a <code>document.Regenerate</code> afterwards, before you set the leader points.</p>
<p>I found the old <a href="https://adndevblog.typepad.com/aec/2016/04/forge-devcon-early-bird-revit-api-moving-a-grid-with-datumplane-method.html">blog post that contains the code</a>.
Seeing the code, I can confirm that my guess was correct.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Combining Edges</h4>
<p>To wrap it up, Lucas Moreira shared a more complex solution
to <a href="https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/combine-connected-edge-segments-into-one-continuous-line/m-p/9126098">combine connected edge segments into one continuous line</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am fetching the edge loops of a face.</p>
<p>When I do so, depending on the original geometry that created the solids, these loop segments can be composed of 2 or more subsegments to form an edge, cf., the orange and red semi-segments below:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/edgesegment.png" alt="Two semi segments forming an edge" width="500"> <!--680-->
<p style="font-size: 80%; font-style:italic">Two semi segments forming an edge</p>
</center></p>
<p>How can I identify and retrieve a continuous line for each edge?</p>
<p>Is there a way I can do that recursively regardless of the number of segments forming the edge?</p>
<p>I am coding for Revit 2019 and retrieving the segments using the <code>Face.EdgeLoops</code> property.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sort the edges so they in the right order</li>
<li>Combine all groups of consecutive collinear edges into single ones</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are hints from StackOverflow for the first:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=sorting+edges+polygon">Search results for 'sorting edges polygon'</a></li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13114378/sorting-vertices-of-a-polygon-in-ccw-or-cw-direction">Sorting vertices of a polygon in CCW or CW direction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The Building Coder provides some older thoughts on sorting and orienting curves to form a contiguous loop:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/sort-and-orient-curves-to-form-a-contiguous-loop.html">Sort and orient curves to form a contiguous loop</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2015/01/autodesk-internship-in-california-and-sorting-edges.html#3">Sorting face loop edges</a></li>
</ul>
<p>One method that does part of the work that you should definitely be aware of is the <code>Edge.AsCurveFollowingFace</code> method that returns a curve corresponding to the edge oriented in its topological direction on the specified face.
That is the simplest option and a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Response:</strong> That helped me a lot and I am really close to a solution.</p>
<p>My scenario is slightly different as I am only using horizontally aligned edges of the exterior face of the geometry.
I think it actually makes it easier, because I don't have to sort the edges, but sort only the segments that would compose one straight edge.</p>
<p>I used the Python node on Dynamo to prototype what I need &ndash; the visual 3d space there helps me with debugging.</p>
<p>What I am doing is getting a list with all the <code>Edges.AsCurveLoops</code>, separating the horizontally aligned ones.
The algorithm evaluates that list and groups the curves to be joined into sublists, because I was already making sure that all the curves are oriented in the same direction.
I just need to pair the curve start points with their matching endpoints and use the unmatched points to form my 'new' undivided edge curve.
I will use the logic
in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13114378/sorting-vertices-of-a-polygon-in-ccw-or-cw-direction">sorting vertices of a polygon in CCW or CW direction</a> for
that.</p>
<p>I know that this code can be optimized, but I will post it here for the sake of completion.
It might help someone:</p>
