<h3>DLL Signature, BIM 2 in UK and AutoCAD.NET</h3>
<p>A couple of quick topics to start the week:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#2">Add-in DLL signature</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">BIM 2 in the UK</a></li>
<li><a href="#4">Communication between AutoCAD and Revit</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Add-In DLL Signature</h4>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/rvtsamples-for-revit-2017.html">migrating RvtSamples to Revit 2017</a>,
the <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2016/04/rvtsamples-for-revit-2017.html#5">'Security – Unsigned Add-In' message</a> is
now displayed by Revit when an unsigned add-in DLL is detected.</p>
<p>We raised that question briefly in
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> thread
on <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api/code-signing-of-revit-addins/td-p/5981560">code signing of Revit addins</a>,
and the issue came up again in another case yesterday:</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> I signed my add-in, expecting that doing so would suppress the 'Security-Unsigned Add-in' message displayed during Revit start-up:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/revit_security_startup_dialog_01.png" alt="'Security-Unsigned Add-in' message" width="548">
</center></p>
<p>However, even when this DLL is signed, a similar dialogue appears, requiring user input:</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/revit_security_startup_dialog_02.png" alt="'Security-Unsigned Add-in' message" width="939">
</center></p>
<p>Can this dialogue be suppressed?</p>
<p>I would prefer it not to interrupt the user experience during Revit start-up.</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please study the new section
on <a href="http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2017/ENU/?guid=GUID-6D11F443-AC95-4B5B-A896-DD745BA0A46D">Digitally Signing Your Revit Add-in</a> in

<p>Have fun with it, and congratulations to the UK BIM community for agreeing on such an important undertaking!</p>

<h4><a name="4"></a>Communication between AutoCAD and Revit</h4>
<p>I am developing an application that will use both AutoCAD and Revit.</p>
<p>I develop a design in AutoCAD and then open that design data in Revit.</p>
<p>What is the best method to achieve this?</p>
<p>I see a couple of feasible options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Direct link between AutoCAD and Revit in a class inheriting from <code>IExternalCommand</code> and passing data directly through method calls.</li>
<li>Using an external third executable program to act as an intermediary.</li>
<li>Using a file as an intermediary.</li>
<li>Implementing a TCP connection between programs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Are there any other options?</p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I would suggest trying number 1 first.</p>
<p>There are two important aspects to consider here.</p>
<p>First, AutoCAD makes it really easy for you, since it provides a COM interface that can be driven through .NET and can be used to access the AutoCAD.NET API from outside AutoCAD.</p>
<p>For instance, through it, you can launch AutoCAD, open, create, read, write and otherwise manipulate a drawing, and close down AutoCAD again.</p>
<p>Secondly, you cannot do the same for Revit.</p>
<p>Revit makes it a little bit harder for you to drive it from outside.</p>
<p>The Revit API is entirely based on events.</p>
<p>You cannot use the Revit API except in a valid Revit API context, and a valid Revit API context is provided by Revit API events and nothing else.</p>
<p>For more details on this, please refer to The Building Coder topic group
on <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/about-the-author.html#5.28">Idling and external events for modeless access and driving Revit from outside</a>.</p>
<p>Now for the good part: the combination of these two is easily possible.</p>
<p>You can implement a Revit add-in that also makes use of the AutoCAD.NET API and thus achieve the direct link that you suggest in item 1.</p>
