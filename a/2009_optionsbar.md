üöÄ Boosting Revit Efficiency with OptionsBar! üèóÔ∏è

Did you know that Revit provides a powerful tool to enhance your workflow? Introducing OptionsBar - a convenient toolbar simplifying the addition of custom tools, options, and extra information.

With OptionsBar, you can:

‚úÖ Add custom tools to the ribbon.
‚úÖ Fine-tune model element parameters in real-time.
‚úÖ Streamline the process of selecting elements in your model.
‚úÖ Create unique user interfaces for Revit.

Want to learn more? Check out the in-depth article on OptionsBar and how to set it up on GitHub:

####<a name="3"></a> Bye Bye DA4R 2018

The Autodesk Platform Services APS consists of several distinct components working together.

One of them is the viewer, which works with a streamlined generic optimised viewing data format, stripped of much of the original information such as constraints and detailed domain-specific information present in the seed CAD files generated by model authoring tools such as AutoCAD, Inventor and Revit.

Another important component is the Design Automation API DA that enables processing, generation and manipulation of the seed CAD files using so-called engines running on virtual machines in the cloud.

Here is a quick reminder that the following engines will be REMOVED on October 30, 2023:

- Autodesk.AutoCAD.20_1
- Autodesk.AutoCAD.21
- Autodesk.AutoCAD.22
- Autodesk.Inventor.2018
- Autodesk.Inventor.22
- Autodesk.Revit.2018

For more information on this, please refer to
the [APS Engine Lifecycle Policy](https://aps.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/engine-lifecycle/).

In general, the following rules apply:

- Engine versions are supported for 4 calendar years after the initial release of the corresponding desktop product.
- After 4 years, the engine version becomes deprecated, but remains available for an additional 2 years and then removed.
- A deprecated engine version can no longer be referenced in new appbundles and activities, but all existing references continue to work.
- All attempts to reference a removed engine version will fail.

So, in the case of Revit, please take heed if you are still using the Revit 2018 engine in DA4R and update to a more recent version before the end of next month.

####<a name="4"></a> Method Draw Online SVG Editor

I keep looking for a handy online vector editor that enables precise measurement, e.g., for creating a simple 2D work sketch with exact millimetre dimensions for a carpentry project.

I found a new likely candidate now, [Method Draw](https://editor.method.ac):

> Method Draw is a simple <a href="https://github.com/methodofaction/Method-Draw">open source</a> vector drawing application. Method Draw was forked from <a href="https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit">SVG-Edit</a> several years ago with the goal of improving and modernizing the interface.

> At this time (2021), the author (<a href="http://method.ac/writing">Mark MacKay</a>) is working on improving stability and improving the codebase, which contains a lot of legacy practices. The goal is to create a vector editor suitable for simple graphic design tasks.

I'll let you know how I get on with that.
If you have a recommendation, please let me know.
Thx!
