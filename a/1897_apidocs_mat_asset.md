  Some feedback (praise and constructive criticism) for the Visual Materials API we exposed a few years ago: https://archi-lab.net/few-more-comments-about-materials-in-revit-dynamo-apis-etc/  @Boris Shafiro @Alex Pytel @Alex Zhang  One interesting question raised was about setting the name for new elements and the need for for a try/catch to ensure uniqueness for the name being assigned; seems we could be doing better there.

  In my opinion this is the sort of documentation we should aim for. Clear, simple, A is B in the other environment.
  There are a lot of consumers of the API now with no coding background as a result of things like Dynamo, PyRevit, and RhinoInside.
  The fact that there isn't a easy to consume 1:1 mapping like this for our complex tool makes it difficult to do things easily and leads to a lot of rants. This is compounded by the go to resource of sharable API info (revitapidocs.com) having apparently fallen into a no-longer-maintained status.
  The concepts we've been doing in depth technical write ups need to be simplified for this large cohort of users. It's a big ask, but would have a HUGE impact.

### RevitApiDocs Update


####<a name="2"></a> RevitApiDocs Support for Revit 2021

Gui Talarico just announced an update to the online Revit API documentation for Revit 2021.1:

> [ApiDocs.co](https://apidocs.co) was updated last month and [RevitApiDocs.com](https://www.revitapidocs.com) last Friday!

Very many thanks to Gui for the great news and all his work on this invaluable resource.

We hope to reduce the turn-around time for the next release &nbsp; :-)

####<a name="3"></a> Welcome, AEC BIM Tools

Simon Jones was one of the first and foremost AEC oriented people at Autodesk for a couple of decades in the previous millennium.
Simon recently left Autodesk after over 35 years with us and launched [AEC BIM Tools](https://www.aecbimtools.com).
He now published his first own Revit add-in, a [Shared Parameter Inspector for Revit](https://www.aecbimtools.com/sharedparameterinspector).

Good luck and much success in your new adventure, Simon!

####<a name="4"></a> Visual Materials API in Dynamo

Konrad K Sobon published
a [few more comments about materials in Revit, Dynamo, APIs etc.](https://archi-lab.net/few-more-comments-about-materials-in-revit-dynamo-apis-etc).

It explores the use of Dynamo to create materials in Revit from something like an Excel spreadsheet, comes up with a number of very useful solutions and also highlights weaknesses in the current API functionality.

The image at the end is especially useful and valuable:

####<a name="5"></a> Innovative Drone Fly-Through Film

One and a half-minute drone video [Right Up Our Alley](https://youtu.be/VgS54fqKxf0) is driving film making to new heights, lengths, curves and other experiences
&ndash; [Hollywood bigwigs shower praise on creators of Minnesota bowling alley drone video](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-12/hollywood-drone-video-minnesota-bowling-alley/13241718):

> A single-take video shot with a drone flying through a Minnesota bowling alley has been hailed as "stupendous" by a string of celebrities and big-name film-makers.
From there, the drone flies in and around bowlers in the lanes and drinkers at the bar, going in between legs and into the back compartment where the bowling pins are swept up and set up and all around &ndash; all in one shot.
It finishes with something of a cliffhanger (SPOILER: No drones were seriously harmed in the making of the video).
Key points:

> - The video is all one-take
- It took about 10 to 12 attempts
- The only thing added in post-production is the audio
- The filmmakers are trying to encourage people to return to bars, restaurants and bowling alleys
- The near 90-second video titled [Right Up Our Alley](https://youtu.be/VgS54fqKxf0) begins outside, the drone swoops in from across the street, through the doors, all around the bowling alley, bar, between people, next to the rolling bowling ball, ...
