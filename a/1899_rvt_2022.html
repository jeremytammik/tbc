- Intriguing new result from the LHCb experiment at CERN
  https://home.cern/news/news/physics/intriguing-new-result-lhcb-experiment-cern
  The LHCb results strengthen hints of a violation of lepton flavour universality
  LHCb (Large Hadron Collider beauty) collaboration
  Today the LHCb experiment at CERN announced new results which, if confirmed, would suggest hints of a violation of the Standard Model of particle physics.

  [Standard Model](https://home.cern/science/physics/standard-model)
  The Standard Model explains how the basic building blocks of matter interact, governed by four fundamental forces.
  The theories and discoveries of thousands of physicists since the 1930s have resulted in a remarkable insight into the fundamental structure of matter: everything in the universe is found to be made from a few basic building blocks called fundamental particles, governed by four fundamental forces. Our best understanding of how these particles and three of the forces are related to each other is encapsulated in the Standard Model of particle physics. Developed in the early 1970s, it has successfully explained almost all experimental results and precisely predicted a wide variety of phenomena. Over time and through many experiments, the Standard Model has become established as a well-tested physics theory.

<p>Let's take a look at some of the enhancements.</p>
<p>First, a quick note on the SDK.</p>
<h4><a name="3"></a> Revit 2022 SDK Coming Soon</h4>
<p>The official Revit 2022 SDK has not yet been released.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, though, I just noticed that
an unofficial <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Revit.SDK">NuGet package of the Autodesk.Revit.SDK</a> version 2022.0.0.2001
&ndash; that I would assume is for Revit 2022 &ndash; was made available already a month ago, cf.
the <a href="https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2021/04/revit-2022-released.html#comment-5335162103">comment by Maxence</a> below.</p>
<p>I haven't looked at that myself, though.</p>
<p>Back to the official material on the product itself, first:</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a> What's New</h4>
<p>The official blog post
on <a href="https://blogs.autodesk.com/revit/2021/04/06/whats-new-in-revit-2022">What’s New in Revit 2022</a> lists
the following main areas of enhancement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interoperability</li>
<li>Documentation efficiency</li>
<li>Design productivity</li>
<li>Developer tools</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamo 2.10.1 with new nodes for Revit Documentation</li>
<li>Point Cloud API</li>
<li>Sketch API</li>
<li>Viewport Label on Sheet API</li>
<li>API for Mapping Cloud Model with Docs URNS</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other important areas do not appear in this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built-in PDF exporter</li>
<li>Deprecation of <code>ParameterType</code> and migration to <code>ForgeTypeId</code></li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="5"></a> Enhancements</h4>
<p>The official <a href="https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/revit-products/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2022/ENU/RevitReleaseNotes/files/2022release/RevitReleaseNotes-2022release-Enhancements-html-html.html">release notes list of enhancements</a> is
too long to include here in its entirety.
I just picked out the main API-related ones.
Most UI-related enhancements that are not listed below are also reflected in the API, of course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new API method Sketch.GetAllElements() to access ElementId of all elements owned by Sketch (ModelCurve, ReferencePlane, Dimension).</li>
<li>Ceiling: Implemented SketchEditScope API to modify sketch-based elements, exposed Ceiling.SketchId property to get the Ceiling Sketch ID, and implemented Ceiling.Create() method to create a new ceiling.</li>
<li>Foundation: Added IsClosed method to API Mesh class.</li>
<li>Macros: Removed the Ruby Macro for Revit.</li>
<li>Point Clouds: Expose single entry point from Revit API for ReCap SDK so that Revit API user can access ReCap managed API.</li>
<li>Sketching: Exposed Sketch.OwnerId property to public API.</li>
<li>View: Exposed new View Title API: Viewport.LabelOffset and Viewport.LabelLineLength.</li>
<li>Wall: Exposed Wall.SketchId property to public API and new methods: to create wall profile Wall.CreateProfileSketch(); method to reset wall profile Wall.RemoveProfileSketch(); method to check whether wall can have a profile Wall.CanHaveProfileSketch().</li>

PG_ELECTRICAL now identifies the parameter group "Electrical", so applications which do not adjust will find their parameters moved from "Electrical Engineering" to "Electrical".</li>
<li>Deprecated the ParameterType enumeration. Added static methods to the Parameter class to retrieve all parameter, group, and spec identifiers.</li>
<li>LabelUtils.GetLabelForSpec(ForgeTypeId) has been changed to support non-measurable specs. Definition.GetSpecTypeId() has been deprecated in favor of Definition.GetDataType().</li>

<li>static BuiltInCategory GetBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId)</li>
<li>static bool IsBuiltInCategory(ForgeTypeId)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deprecated UnitGroup enumeration. Use ForgeTypeId instead. References to specific values of the UnitGroup enumeration may be replaced with references to the properties of new class DisciplineTypeId. Deprecated method UnitUtils.GetUnitGroup(ForgeTypeId). Use new method UnitUtils.GetDiscipline(ForgeTypeId) instead. Added new method LabelUtils.GetLabelForDiscipline(ForgeTypeId). Added new method UnitUtils.GetAllDisciplines().</li>

<li>Improved Revit API functionality related to Family Type shared parameters.</li>
<li>Added ForgeTypeId constants to nested classes Boolean, Int, Reference, and String within the SpecTypeId class identifying non-floating-point parameter data types.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4><a name="7"></a> Microservices and Serverless Architecture</h4>
<p>Now for some non-Revit stuff:</p>
<p>Are you interested in microservices and serverless architecture?</p>
<p>MongoDB provides a whitepaper on the topic,
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/collateral/download-the-oo-guide-to-microservices-and-serverless-architecture">The Object Oriented Guide to Microservices and Serverless Architecture</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Serverless application architecture is a logical extension of the microservices trend toward smaller and smaller services.</p>
<p>We look at how web application architecture is changing, by looking through an Object Oriented Design lens at the principles driving change in today’s market.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a name="8"></a> Questioning the Standard Model Theory</h4>
<p>An <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/intriguing-new-result-lhcb-experiment-cern">intriguing new result from the LHCb experiment at CERN</a>
strengthens hints of a violation of lepton flavour universality.
