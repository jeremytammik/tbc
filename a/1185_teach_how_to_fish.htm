<h3>Teaching a Man How To Fish and Schedule Creation</h3>

<p>As you all know, we at ADN spend a significant amount of our time ensuring that API information is available and easy to find for all.</p>

<p>In order to find something, though, you often need to invest at least a minimum amount of effort in searching.</p>

<p>This can be practiced, of course, and I obtain a useful answer to almost every question I ever have on any subject whatsoever from a single Internet search.</p>

<p>Here are two examples of performing a search for an example of programmatic Revit schedule creation, both desktop and Internet based:</p>

<h4>Two Ways to Search for a Schedule Creation Example</h4>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> I am importing an Excel sheet into a Revit schedule.</p>

<p>How can I add all the fields from the Excel sheet along with the data to the Revit schedule using the Revit API?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> Please excuse me for asking, but this question comes up in my poor little head at almost every query I receive from you: Do you perform any searches for information yourself before submitting a question like this to ADN?</p>

<p>The reason I ask is that I imagine it would save you time, and us as well, of course. We are spending a significant amount of time ensuring that all important API information is publicly available and easily found by the Internet search engines.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is how I approached your question:</p>

<ol>
<li>I looked at the Revit API help file RevitAPI.chm. I did not immediately see an answer.</li>
<li>I opened the SDK sample project SDKSamples2015.sln and searched globally for 'schedule'.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the result of the latter, omitting all but the first hit in each project:</p>

<pre>

  Matching lines: 323    Matching files: 35    Total files searched: 989
</pre>

<p>As you can see, nine SDK samples out of a total of 173 projects deal with schedules in one way or another:</p>

<ul>
<li>RoomSchedule</li>
<li>AllViews</li>
<li>PanelSchedule</li>
<li>RoutingPreferenceTools</li>
<li>ScheduleCreation</li>
<li>PostCommandWorkflow</li>
<li>ScheduleAutomaticFormatter</li>
<li>ScheduleToHTML</li>
<li>DuplicateViews</li>
</ul>

<p>I will leave the rest of this exercise up to you.</p>

<p>As a hint (sorry, I cannot stop myself, I need to check): the entire summary in the readme file of the SDK sample that I recommend you take a look at reads like this:</p>

<p>"<strong>Summary:</strong>  This sample introduces how to create a view schedule and how to show its data on a sheet."</p>

<p>I even tested the sample successfully to make sure it really does what you need using RvtSamples > Views > ScheduleAPI.</p>

<p>The sample makes use of the Revit Schedule API, which was introduced in Revit 2013.</p>

<p>The Building Coder even defines an own category for it: <a href-"http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/schedule">Schedule</a>.</p>

<p>That was the desktop oriented approach.</p>

<p>Another, more modern approach that also yields useful results can be encapsulated in one single line and one single click:</p>

<p>Simply google for

<p>You know the story about teaching a man how to fish?</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you do not mind me pointing it out to you so directly.</p>

<p>I even wrote about this topic once before, way back in the very beginnings of The Building Coder, more than five years ago, on

<a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2009/02/creating-a-group-and-how-to-fish.html">

<h4>Addendum</h4>

<p>Unbelievably enough, this is still not the end of the story.</p>

<p>Look what came next:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In my query I had clearly mentioned that I want to do the task using REVIT API 2013.</p>

<p>You have given me the SDK link for Revit API 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> I am aware that you are working with Revit 2013, and pointed that out explicitly in my answer to you.</p>

<p>Do you mean to tell me that you need help finding the ScheduleCreation sample in the Revit 2013 SDK?</p>

<p>Do you have the Revit 2013 SDK installed at all?</p>

<p>I would expect you to have installed this already.</p>

<p>Simply search the Revit SDK for the ScheduleCreation folder.</p>

<p>Better still, simply open it in the Visual Studio SDKSamples2013.sln solution.</p>

<p>If you have not yet installed the SDK, it is available from the Revit API

getting started material</a>.</p>

<p>Luckily for you, the Revit 2013 SDK is still available for download from the

<a href="http://www.autodesk.com/developrevit">Revit Developer Centre</a>.</p>

<p>Please excuse me for saying so, but the information I am providing here is very basic indeed, and I should really not be wasting either my time or yours spelling it out to you in such detail.</p>

<p>Once again, everything I have said above is immediately available from on single Google search, using the keywords

<a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=revit+2013+sdk+download">revit 2013 sdk download</a>.
