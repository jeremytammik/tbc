### Save and Restore Camera

Dear Jeremy,

I have a question about View3D Camera settings. I want to serialize view 3D camera orientation. It works fine if a projection mode is perspective. When I zoom in/out method GetOrientation gives correct values for Perspective camera (position of the camera is changed), but in Orthographic projection mode GetOrientation always returns the same value regardless of zoom in/out (position of the camera is changed), so I can't recreate saved camera orientation in Orthographic mode. There should be another Transformation to apply, but I don't know where to take it from.

I need to change position manually in order to apply changes made by zoom in/out.

I found, there is a method GetZoomCorners of class UIView, this is a bounding box. It's values changed after zoom in/out, but how to move EyePosition according to it.

Any suggestions?

Thanks.

I investigated the problem of saving/restoring current Revit View 3D. For a perspective projection mode, it was very simple, just save camera parameters and then restore them. But for orthographic projection mode, I found that camera parameters are not changed after zooming or panning the model (compare figure 1 and figure 2).

Figure 2 Camera parameters after zooming and panning

After desperate Googling I found the solution of this task in GitHub, in the 
[RevitView.cs module](https://github.com/teocomi/BCFier/blob/master/Bcfier.Revit/Data/RevitView.cs) of
the [BCFier project](https://github.com/teocomi/BCFier)
by [@mgrzelak](https://github.com/mgrzelak).

The idea is:

Saving:

1. Get corners of the active UI view Corner1 {x1,y1,z1} and Corner2 {x2,y2,z2}

  IList<uiview> views = uidoc.GetOpenUIViews();
  UIView currentView = views.Where(t => t.ViewId == view3D.Id).FirstOrDefault();
  //Corners of the active UI view
  IList<xyz> corners = currentView.GetZoomCorners();
  XYZ corner1 = corners[0];
  XYZ corner2 = corners[1];

2. Calculate center point {0.5(x1+x2),0.5(y1+y2),0.5(z1+z2)}

  double x = (corner1.X + corner2.X) / 2;
  double y = (corner1.Y + corner2.Y) / 2;
  double z = (corner1.Z + corner2.Z) / 2;
  //center of the UI view
  XYZ viewCenter = new XYZ(x, y, z);

3. Calculate diagonal vector

  diagVector = Corner1-Corner2={x1-x2,y1-y2,z1-z2}
  XYZ diagVector = corner1 - corner2;

4. Get up and right vectors

  ViewOrientation3D viewOrientation3D = view3D.GetOrientation();
  XYZ upDirection = viewOrientation3D.UpDirection;
  XYZ rightDirection = forwardDirection.CrossProduct(upDirection);

5. Calculate height=abs(diagVector*upVector);

  double height = Math.Abs(diagVector.DotProduct(upDirection));

6. Find scale = 0.5*height

But, the provided solution doesnâ€™t work correctly if the height > width.

So, we need to take into account both height and width:

  double height = Math.Abs(diagVector.DotProduct(upDirection));
  double width = Math.Abs(diagVector.DotProduct(rightDirection));

Then we have to find the minimal minside = min(height,width)

  double minside = Math.Min(height, width);

6. scale = 0.5*minside

7. Save center point (eyePosition=viewCenter), upDirection, forwardDirection and scale.

Restoring is the same as in provided above link to GitHub project:

1. Get prevously saved eyePosition, upDirection, forwardDirection and scale.
2. Move the camera to preciously saved eyePosition

  var orientation = new ViewOrientation3D(eyePosition, upDirection, forwardDirection);
  view3D.SetOrientation(orientation);

3. Calculate corners of square

Up_Left:

  Corner1 = eyePosition+scale*upVector-scale*rightVector

Down_Right:

  Corner2 = eyePosition-scale*upVector+scale*rightVector

  XYZ Corner1 = position + upDirection* scale - uidoc.ActiveView.RightDirection * scale;
  XYZ Corner2 = position - upDirection* scale + uidoc.ActiveView.RightDirection * scale;

4. ZoomCorners

  ZoomAndCenterRectangle(Corner1, Corner2);
  uidoc.GetOpenUIViews().FirstOrDefault(t => t.ViewId == view3D.Id).ZoomAndCenterRectangle(Corner1, Corner2);

See figure 4 in the reply below.

Dear Valerii,

Wow! Thank you very much for this impressive solution! I'll work about putting this into a main blog post for enhanced readability and visibility.

Cheers, Jeremy.

Thanks Jeremy, I just wanted to ask you about it. I'm going to add some extra info to the post today, then you can post it in your blog.

Very cool!

Is it ready for posting now, or did you want to add anything more?

Would you like share a small complete sample, so one doesn't have to put together the individual snippets piece by piece?

Thank you!

Valerii Nozdrenkov --> jeremy tammik

Thanks Jeremy,

It's ready!

A complete sample is a good idea, but It will take some time. I let you know when it's ready. Should it be on GitHub?

jeremy tammik --> Valerii Nozdrenkov

Yes, absolutely! GitHub would be great! Thank you! Happy Monday!

Hi Jeremy,

I have prepared a sample project for described above task Sample project link on GitHub:

https://github.com/Valerii-Nozdrenkov/RevitOrthoCamera

Please, publish it in your blog, if you find it acceptable.

Thanks.
