<h3>Q4R4 tbc Import and RevitLookup</h3>
<p>I started working on the question answering
system <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/03/q4r4-revit-api-question-answering-system.html">Q4R4 <em>Question Answering for Revit API</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first step is to import The Building Coder blog posts into Elasticsearch and experiment with full-text queries on them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are proud to present yet more enhancements to the revamped version of RevitLookup:</p>

<li><a href="#2">Q4R4 sources and result presentation</a></li>
<li><a href="#3">Importing <code>tbc</code> blog posts into Elasticsearch</a></li>

</ul>
<h4><a name="2"></a>Q4R4 Question Sources and Result Presentation</h4>
<p>One aspect of q4r4 is searching, and another is what results to present and how.</p>
<p>One useful approach that comes to mind might be:</p>
<p>Given a query, return the most relevant results separately from several different resource collections:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Revit API help file</li>
<li>The Revit add-in developer guide</li>
<li>The Revit SDK sample collection</li>
<li>Revit API discussion forum threads</li>
<li>The Building Coder blog posts</li>
<li>Anonymised ADN case answers</li>
<li>StackOverflow queries</li>
</ul>
<h4><a name="3"></a>Importing <code>tbc</code> Blog Posts into Elasticsearch</h4>
<p>As mentioned
in <a href="http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/03/q4r4-revit-api-question-answering-system.html">the last post on q4r4</a>,
I should start off implementing a simple but intelligent search engine without worrying about machine learning or AI in any of its forms.</p>
<p>I am still reading
about <a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> and
figuring out how to set up an experimental system to try this out.</p>
<p><center>
<img src="img/icon-elasticsearch-bb.png" alt="Elasticsearch" width="84"/>
</center></p>
<p>I started with the The Building Coder blog posts, since I have them all in handy text format, either HTML or Markdown, publicly accessible in
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/tbc">tbc GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p>I want to import all posts' full text into Elasticsearch.</p>
<p>A similar topic is discussed 
in <a href="https://bitquabit.com/post/having-fun-python-and-elasticsearch-part-1/">having fun with Python and Elasticsearch, Part 1</a>.</p>
<p>I installed the <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/python-api/current/index.html">Elasticsearch Python library</a> and
implemented a module <code>tbcimport.py</code> to read
the <a href="http://jeremytammik.github.io/tbc/a">tbc main blog post index</a> and open each HTML file on the local system.</p>
<h4><a name="4"></a>Listing and Clearing the Elasticsearch <code>tbc</code> Index</h4>
<p>For testing purposes, it is useful to be able to list all posts imported so far and delete the entire collection to clean up and retry; here are two <code>curl</code> commands to achieve that:</p>
<ul>
<li>List all posts:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/tbc/_search?pretty'
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Clear the <code>tbc</code> index:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
curl -XDELETE 'localhost:9200/tbc?pretty'
</pre>

<h4><a name="5"></a>Strip and Clean Up HTML for JSON Document</h4>
<p>After reading the main blog post index file, I need to extract the text from the HTML contents and put it into a JSON document for Elasticsearch to imbibe.</p>
<p>Some useful hints for this are provided here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/scrape/">Hitchhiker's Guide to Python &ndash; HTML scraping</a></li>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/328356/extracting-text-from-html-file-using-python">Extracting text from HTML file using Python</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I settled for a very simple HTML text extractor using the <code>htmllib</code> <code>HTMLParser</code>.</p>
<p>It initially wrote the text to standard output, but I was able to pass a file-like <code>StringIO</code> object into the <code>DumbWriter</code> constructor to intercept it.</p>
<p>On the first attempt, I successfully imported the first nine posts.
Post number 10, <em>Selecting all Walls</em>, failed with a <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code> error message.</p>
<pre>
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xa0 in position 2595: invalid start byte
</pre>

<p>As it turned out, the offending file was stored in a Windows encoding.
I converted it to UTF-8.</p>
<p>Next, I went one step further and eliminated all non-ASCII characters by adding <code>re.sub( r'[^\x00-\x7f]', r'', my_stringio.getvalue() )</code> to the result of stripping the HTML tags.</p>
<p>This will presumably corrupt some foreign names, expressions, and text passages.
I would not expect those passages to be of any major importance for Revit API related queries anyway.</p>
<p>I also added an assertion to ensure that the filenames listed in <code>index.html</code> really do exist.</p>
<p>A surprising number of errors were discovered and fixed in the process.</p>
<p>Now I have successfully imported all The Building Coder blog posts into Elasticsearch.</p>
<h4><a name="6"></a>Q4R4 GitHub Repo and <code>tbcimport.py</code> Script</h4>
<p>I celebrated this first step by creating
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/q4r4">q4r4 GitHub repository</a>,
adding <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/q4r4/blob/master/tbcimport.py">tbcimport.py</a> to it in its current functional state, 
and creating <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/q4r4/releases/tag/1.0.0">q4r4 release 1.0.0</a>.</p>
<p>Here is the script in its current state:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/jeremytammik/d834055f2f4943c4bbe97beb85d803cc.js"></script>

<p>The next thing to do is to start experimenting with queries, and presumably with ways to optimise the resulting hits.</p>
<h4><a name="7"></a>RevitLookup Bug Fixes</h4>
<p>While I am fiddling with q4r4,
the <a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160">Revit API discussion forum</a> and 
other Revit API related issues remain as vibrant as ever.</p>
<p>Some new enhancements were added to our irreplaceable Revit BIM database exploration
tool <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup</a>.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, it was significantly restructured to use <code>Reflection</code> and reduce code duplication:</p>

</ul>
<p>Alexander Ignatovich, <a href="https://github.com/CADBIMDeveloper">@CADBIMDeveloper</a>, aka Александр Игнатович,
now submitted a few new bug fixes in
his <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/29/commits">pull request #29</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move <code>CollectorExtElement</code> field initialization to constructor, use linq extension methods instead of linq syntax</li>
<li>Get types only from <code>AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory</code>, the Revit.exe directory path. 
I have a dll with a name that contains the substring "revit".
This library depends on another library in another location.
I have an <code>Assembly.Resolve</code> event subscription to load dependencies correctly.
In such case this code fails, because it can't be aware of correct paths to load referenced libraries.</li>
<li>Fix bug in getting <code>Application.Documents</code> when more than one document is opened.
The <code>Close</code> method must not be called &ndash; it successfully closes non-active documents and fails to get information about them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to Alexander for these improvements!</p>
<p>I integrated them 
into <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.19">RevitLookup release 2017.0.0.19</a>.</p>
<h4><a name="8"></a>RevitLookup Icons</h4>
<p>Just a few hours after Alexander's bug fixes,
Ehsan <a href="https://github.com/eirannejad">@eirannejad</a> Iran-Nejad chipped in with some further important improvements in
his <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/pull/30/commits">pull request #30</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added and updated icon package<ul>
<li>Added icon for RevitLookup button in Revit UI</li>
<li>Added icon to RevitLookup forms</li>
<li>Revised icons for RevitLookup menu bar</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added exception handling<ul>
<li><code>Path.GetDirectoryName</code> throws <code>System.ArgumentException if the assembly</code>Location` is null.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to Ehsan for these improvements!</p>
<p>I integrated them 
into <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup/releases/tag/2017.0.0.20">RevitLookup release 2017.0.0.20</a>.</p>
<p>The most up-to-date version is always provided in the master branch of 
the <a href="https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup">RevitLookup GitHub repository</a>.</p>
