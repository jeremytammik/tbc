### Open Source Access All Forge Properties

Many thanks to all the numerous brilliant contributors to
the [Revit API discussion forum](http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/revit-api-forum/bd-p/160),
above all, during the past weeks,
Richard [RPThomas108](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/user/viewprofilepage/user-id/1035859) Thomas,
continueing to provide tremendous help on the hard questions requiring both Revit API understanding and in-depth product usage experience.

Today, let's take a quick look at a Forge issue related to Revit property access:





####<a name="2"></a> Pull Metadata from RVT in BIM 360

**Question:** I am looking for a way to pull metadata from all the Revit files that live in BIM 360 using Forge to then represent it on PowerBi.
I looked at a previous suggestion on using the Design Automation API but was unable to use that because it requires `ngrok`, which is not approved by my company.
Also, as far as I can tell from the [forge-customproperty-revit](https://github.com/augustogoncalves/forge-customproperty-revit) documentation on extracting compound layer information with the Revit engine, it would have to go to each file, one by one, to extract this meta data.

However, I can see the required data with the model viewer API. I was informed that even though I could view it, I would not be able to extract it using that API.

The data lives in Revit with in the sheet properties, in the section labeled identity data:

I have also CC’d my colleague Anna Roig because we are working together to get this done.

Thank you,

Hi Jeremy,

Correct, the Design Automation API doesn’t need ngrok. I meant to say that it was needed for the example in the link that I included that Forge Support suggested using as a starting point. Sorry for the confusion.

As for the Viewer API, I previously asked someone from a Forge program and they informed me that I would be able to see it but not extract it because that isn’t built into the API. So you’re saying if I manipulate the JavaScript in the Viewer API I would be able to automate and extract the fields I need within every Revit file on the project?

Thank you for this information.

Dear Team, can you please confirm (or not) one basic statement that I like making on JavaScript access to model data in the Forge Viewer: afaik, *you can use JavaScript in the Viewer API to access and manipulate all the model data, with no restriction*, obviously also covering the fields within the Revit model you are interested in. True or False? Thank you! -- zen ticket nr. 8252

Hi Rene,

Thank you for your clarification.

As said, I am more focussed on working with the Revit .NET API, so I am not the perfect choice to address this person.

And yes indeed, afaik, you can use JavaScript in the Viewer API to access and manipulate all the model data, with no restriction, obviously also covering the fields within the Revit model you are interested in.

For safety's sake, I am asking my more knowledgeable colleagues to confirm.

Best regards,

Jeremy Tammik

they can find the correct statement inside the `viewer3d.js` source file:

> Autodesk Forge Viewer Usage Limitations:

> The Autodesk Forge viewer can only be used to view files generated by Autodesk Forge services. The Autodesk Forge Viewer JavaScript must be delivered from an Autodesk hosted URL.

Stephen Preston

Its better to point them to the same text in the documentation, at the bottom of this page:

https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/developers_guide/overview/

Jeremy Tammik

Thank you for the clarification @Augusto Goncalves and @Stephen Preston, and Happy New Year to you too, by the way.

My question is: are all model properties that can be seen in the viewer also accessible via JavaScript? My assumption is YES. Is that correct?

Augusto Goncalves

yes, using the GET Properties endpoint:

https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/model-derivative/v2/reference/http/urn-metadata-guid-properties-GET/

Traian Stanev

All properties can be accessed via JavaScript using `model.getProperties(elementID)`

They cannot be modified, the viewer (being a viewer) is read-only.

If the model is already loaded, it's better to use the JS API, rather than the Forge REST API, because all properties are automatically downloaded by the viewer and available locally to the JS context.

Jeremy Tammik

brilliant! mille grazie a tutti!
