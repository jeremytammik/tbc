  basically, I lower the voltage to my CPU to the point it is just stable, and with that reduction, I can run the processor at a higher clock speed.

### BIM365 Getting Started, Materials API, CPU Voltage

As mentioned, [I am on vacation](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/element-identifiers-in-rvt-ifc-nw-and-forge.html#6) right now,
enjoying splendid weather camping on the coast of the Atlantic.

####<a name="2"></a> Getting Started and Programming Buttons with Revit API

Zach Smith reached out and pointed to his new
blogging platform [BIM365](https://www.bim365.tech) together
with collaborators Matt Boltik and Andrell Laniewicz:

> BIM365 is a blog written by BIM users for the BIM industry. With contributors from various backgrounds, focuses, and skills, this blog aims to be a collaboration for BIM minds.

His first two posts are of interest to all Revit API aficionados:

- [Programming Buttons in Revit](https://www.bim365.tech/blog/programming-buttons-in-revit)

Welcome to the Revit API blogosphere and thank you for sharing, Zach!


####<a name="3"></a> Links to API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials

For the sake of completeness, here is the official link to the information presented by Boris Shafiro at Autodesk University 2017:

- [New API to Modify Visual Appearance of Materials in Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/autodesk-university/class/New-API-Modify-Visual-Appearance-Materials-Revit-2017)

The Building Coder presented some of the material in the discussion
on [modifying material visual appearance](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2017/11/modifying-material-visual-appearance.html).

This new link includes the full collection of class materials:

- Overview
- Video &ndash; 45 minutes
- Handout &ndash; 21 pages
- Presentation &ndash; 33 slides


####<a name="4"></a> Improving Performance by Optimising CPU Voltage

Daniel Gijsbers noticed the description and solution to
my [MacBook Pro overheating problem](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#5) and
very kindly responded:

> I read your [blog post](https://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com/blog/2019/06/accessing-bim360-cloud-links-thumbnail-and-dynamo.html#4).
Regarding your mac book having heat problems, it’s good you cleaned the fans.

> What you could also look into is
whether [improving performance by optimising CPU voltage](https://danielgijsbers.blogspot.com/2018/10/performance.html) is
also possible for a mac.
Basically, I lower the voltage to my CPU to the point it is just stable; with that reduction, I can run the processor at a higher clock speed.
