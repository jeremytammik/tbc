<h3>Area Boundary Segments</h3>

<p>Here are some notes on the properties and ordering of area boundary segments from a case handled by my colleagues Katsuaki Takamizawa, Harry Mattison and Tamas Badics:</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong>
I am analysing a Revit area element, marked below by the red circle, with another adjacent area beside it:</p>

<img src="img/area_boundary_segments_1.jpg" alt="Area boundary"/>

<p>I would have assumed this area to have 4 segments in its boundary. 
When I use the RvtMgdDbg snoop functionality to explore it, though, it displays 5 segments:</p>

<p>Is this the expected behaviour? 
If so, I cannot simply use the vertex and edge count to analyse an area and determine whether it is triangular or rectangular.
Instead, I have to check whether adjacent edges are parallel, and if so, treat them as one edge instead of two.</p>

<p>Concerning the ordering of edges, I have drawn the lines using the edge coordinates, starting from segment 0 in red and ending with segment 4 in dark blue:</p>

<p>The boundary segments seem to be stored in counter clockwise order. 
Is this always true?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong>
The order of storage is counter clockwise for outer boundaries and clockwise for inner boundaries. 
For instance, imagine a room with an island at the centre. 
It will have two boundaries, one outer, and one inner.</p>

<p>As for the number of segments, what you see is expected in this situation.</p>

<h4>Questions for you</h4>

<p>By the way, before we close, I have two questions for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is anyone out there using RealDWG inside a Revit add-in, to read DWG files in native format?</li>
<li>Does anyone know of a profiler that works with Revit 2010 add-ins?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you!</p>
