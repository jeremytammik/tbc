08720371 [PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement - Active View]

<h3>Set a Suitable View for Family Instance Placement</h3>

<p>Matt Taylor of <a href="http://www.wspgroup.com">WSP</a> raised

an issue related to the use of the PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement method, now that API access is also possible in the project browser view.</p>

<p>He also went right ahead to suggest and implement a solution:</p>


<p><strong>Question:</strong> One of the new features of the Revit 2014 API is the possibility to select elements within the Project Browser view.</p>

<p>If the Project Browser view is active, selecting a ribbon control that uses PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement will fail because the user will try to pick in the active drawing view to place the family instance.</p>

<p>According to the help for PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement: "Users are not permitted to change the active view during this placement operation (the operation will be completed)."</p>

<p>If there is only one active UIView, it's easy to just set it to active prior to calling PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement. If more than one view is open, how can I get the last active drawing view (prior to the Project Browser)?</p>

<p>Short of implementing a ViewActivated event (seems like overkill), or prompting the user to click in a view before using PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement (not always required, inconsistent across 2011/2012/2013), what can be done?</p>


<p><strong>Answer:</strong> It should be possible and not an all-to-big effort to implement a ViewActivated event handler and simply make a note of each view activated. Then, before calling PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement, revert to the last valid one for that operation. Would that solve the issue for you?</p>


<p><strong>Response:</strong> Here is the

<a href="zip/mt_suitable_view.zip">
zipped view activated solution</a>,

mainly copied from your blog’s example, though in VB.NET.</p>

<p>It was substantially simpler than I envisaged &ndash; an hour of work to implement.</p>

<p>In OnStartup, we instantiate a dictionary mapping each document to the last valid PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement view and subscribe to the view activated event:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="green">''' </span><span class="gray">&lt;summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">''' Map document title to last valid view element id</span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">''' </span><span class="gray">&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
&nbsp; <span class="blue">Public</span> <span class="blue">Shared</span> viewHash <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="teal">Hashtable</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">Public</span> <span class="blue">Function</span> OnStartup( _
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ByVal</span> application <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="teal">UIControlledApplication</span>) _
&nbsp; <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="teal">Result</span> <span class="blue">Implements</span> <span class="teal">IExternalApplication</span>.OnStartup
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Try</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; viewHash = <span class="blue">New</span> <span class="teal">Hashtable</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">AddHandler</span> application.ViewActivated,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">AddressOf</span> OnViewActivated
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Return</span> <span class="teal">Result</span>.Succeeded
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Catch</span> ex <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="teal">Exception</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Return</span> <span class="teal">Result</span>.Failed
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">Try</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">Function</span>
</pre>

<p>In the view activated event handler, we simply make a note of the last view activated for each document, provided it is a valid view to call the PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement in, i.e. not a system browser or project browser view:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="blue">Private</span> <span class="blue">Shared</span> <span class="blue">Function</span> ViewDescription( _
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ByVal</span> v <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">View</span>) <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="blue">String</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Return</span> <span class="blue">String</span>.Format(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;view '{0}' in document '{1}'&quot;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; v.Name, v.Document.Title)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">Function</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">Private</span> <span class="blue">Sub</span> OnViewActivated( _
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ByVal</span> sender <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="blue">Object</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">ByVal</span> e <span class="blue">As</span> UI.Events.<span class="teal">ViewActivatedEventArgs</span>)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> docTitle <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="blue">String</span> = e.Document.Title
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> vPrevious <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">View</span> = e.PreviousActiveView
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> vCurrent <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">View</span> = e.CurrentActiveView
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">If</span> <span class="blue">Not</span> (vCurrent.ViewType = <span class="teal">ViewType</span>.SystemBrowser _
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">OrElse</span> vCurrent.ViewType = <span class="teal">ViewType</span>.ProjectBrowser) <span class="blue">Then</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">If</span> viewHash.ContainsKey(docTitle) <span class="blue">Then</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; viewHash.Item(docTitle) = vCurrent.Id
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Else</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; viewHash.Add(docTitle, vCurrent.Id)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">If</span>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">If</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> s <span class="blue">As</span> <span class="blue">String</span> = <span class="blue">If</span>(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (vPrevious <span class="blue">Is</span> <span class="blue">Nothing</span>),
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;no view at all&quot;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;previous &quot;</span> + ViewDescription(vPrevious))
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="teal">Debug</span>.Print(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">String</span>.Format(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="maroon">&quot;Switching from {0} to new {1}.&quot;</span>,
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; s, ViewDescription(vCurrent)))
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">Sub</span>
</pre>

<p>With that information available, we can always switch to the last valid view before calling the PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement method, e.g. like this:</p>

<pre class="code">
&nbsp; <span class="green">' According to the help for </span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">' PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement:</span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">' &quot;Users are not permitted to change the active </span>

&nbsp; <span class="green">' (With previous versions, the ribbon items are </span>
&nbsp; <span class="green">' greyed out if the project browser is active.)</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> actView <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">View</span> = doc.ActiveView
&nbsp;
&nbsp; <span class="blue">If</span> actView.ViewType = DB.<span class="teal">ViewType</span>.SystemBrowser _
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">OrElse</span> actView.ViewType = DB.<span class="teal">ViewType</span>.ProjectBrowser <span class="blue">Then</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">' Get stored view id.</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">If</span> AppCommand.viewHash.ContainsKey(doc.Title) <span class="blue">Then</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> prevValidViewId <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">ElementId</span> _
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; = AppCommand.viewHash.Item(doc.Title)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">Dim</span> elem <span class="blue">As</span> DB.<span class="teal">Element</span> = doc.GetElement(
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; prevValidViewId)
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">If</span> elem <span class="blue">IsNot</span> <span class="blue">Nothing</span> <span class="blue">Then</span>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="green">' (Likely to be the case, as the user </span>

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; docUI.ActiveView = view

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="blue">End</span> <span class="blue">If</span>

&nbsp;
&nbsp; docUI.PromptForFamilyInstancePlacement(

<h4>Factory Design Mobile App</h4>

<p>The

<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autodesk-factory-design/id657389678?ls=1&mt=8">
Factory Design Mobile</a>,

available on the Apple App Store, enables iPad users to create and review factory layouts in the field.</p>

<p>It presents a 2D layout environment to conceptualize designs, adjust them based on field observations and collaborate with partners.</p>

<p>Besides being an independent conceptual design tool for factory layouts, FDM also supports synchronization with existing designs.
You can review your design live on the factory floor and synchronize changes from the floor to the final design, including updating both 2D and 3D representations of the factory.</p>
