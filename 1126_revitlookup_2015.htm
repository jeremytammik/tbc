<h3>RevitLookup for Revit 2015</h3>

<p>My first post dealing with Revit 2015 is dedicated to RevitLookup, the most important Revit database exploration tool, both for developers and interested non-developers.</p>

<p>This is particularly urgent, since RevitLookup no longer is included in the standard Revit SDK (software development kit).</p>

<p>It is now available from the

<a href="">RevitLookup GitHub repository</a> instead.</p>

<p>I created a preliminary version of RevitLookup for the Revit 2015 Meridian pre-release, just to ensure that everybody who needs access to this tool has it available right away.</p>

</center>

<p>It compiles and runs perfectly fine, although some compilation warnings on use of deprecated API functionality are displayed.</p>

<p>It currently refers to the Revit API assemblies located in the Revit Meridian root installation folder.
That path needs to be updated to compile for an official release of Revit 2015.</p>

<h4>Migration</h4>

<p>Here are the steps I performed for the migration, which was extremely straightforward:</p>

<ol>
<li>Replaced the RevitAPI.dll and RevitAPIUI.dll references.</li>
<li>Changed the .NET framework from 4.0 to 4.5.</li>

<li>Rebuilt all. It compiles successfully, generating
<a href="zip/revit_lookup_2015_warnings_01.txt">0 errors and 24 warnings</a>.</li>

<li>Fixed a few of the deprecated API usage occurrences:</li>
<ul>
<li>Rewrote FamilyUtil.GetFamilySymbol using GetFamilySymbolIds instead of Symbols.</li>
<li>Ditto in TypeSelectorForm.GetAvailableSymbols.</li>
<li>Ditto in Importer.UpdateFamilySymbol.</li>
<li>Rewrote TestElements.ViewToNewSheetHardwired to use ViewSheet.GetAllPlacedViews instead of ViewSheet.Views.</li>
</ul>
<li>Updated the version number to 2015.0.0.0.</li>
</ol>

<p>The fixes are currently marked with a comment:</p>

<pre>
  // jeremy migrated from Revit 2014 to 2015:
</pre>

<p>That will probably be removed again soon, since the same information can be easily gleaned from the version control system.</p>
